The idea here is to have some test datasets for the GZAP data structures. That should include: 

- options
  - options on futures
  - options on cash (e.g. on indexes)
- futures
- indexes
- ETFs

and we should have 

- EOD close price
- intraday (trade or index) price
- OHLC prices

formatted data. Speaking of formatted data, we should have some raw data from standard sources like 

- Bloomberg
- Cboe DataShop
- CME
