- Bloomberg fields for replicating iShares super-precise NAV: FUND_TOTAL_ASSETS / EQY_SH_OUT

o met with Yoshiki - I need to constantly restate the question, plan steps for answering the question earlier in the process

. how do TLT VIX regimes differ from 10-year Treasury VIX regimes?
  - literally start with 2 stacked panels - 10-year regimes on top, TLT on bottom, NO VIX; use this to come up with lead-lag/duration
  - look at lead-lag - check the algorithm outputs; who leads more, and in what way (# days, # of leads) does it "lead"?
  - look at duration (of full regimes, of difference periods) - fill in whatever the algorithm doesn't have
x Credit VIX case studies - 2 events
  - we need to look at both % (to compare to VIX) and bp (to compare HY against IG)
  - pull representative assets to represent sectors (no easy replacement for AGG in Europe?):
    - USD: TY1 Comdty (or GOVT, IEF, TLT) for gov't bonds, HYG for corp HY sector, LQD for corp IG sector, SPX for equity
    - Euro: SEGA for (IG) gov't bonds, IHYG for corp HY sector, IEAC for corp IG sector, Stoxx 600 for equity
  - 1) 2019-10, China trade war?
    2) yield curve inversion - whether it affected Credit VIX
. update FIVIX primer
  - doing this will involve finishing GZAP overhaul
    - combo-regimes color scheme: green LL, blue LH, red HL, purple HH
  - re-investigate Credit VIX underlying rolls again
x go through Tableau futures-related material to gauge what kind of data/analysis we have
x look through futures fair value stuff from Dimitrios
x meet with John and Parth with futures

#### 2020-11-04
x Respond to Johnny Pesenti on Salesforce meeting

o call with BlackRock analysts - ask 1) what time, 2) "what's the relationship of these numbers to those in the daily TLT holdings files?"
  - when does new shares outstanding get determined?
  - sent a wall of text email to them. embarrassing

o Yoshiki weekly research meeting
  - bigger multiplier with Credit VIX than VIX, more leverage, could be a reason to trade
  - lognormal percentage vol of spreads - note that high yield could have same % spike but much bigger absolute spike
    - def use bp for comparisons between Credit VIXs
  - credit vol against equity vol is what our target traders do; don't try trading US against EU
  - "why is it different from what's out there?" "why better than VIX?" "where's the hedge?"
  - everyone do an analysis on election using VIXs - why is something more credit sensitive, or rate sensitive, or equity sensitive
  - focus on March, where the reaction differs between the indexes
  - emphasize hedging IHYG, break it up into 3 stories, include Euro Stoxx context, look at basis point spiking for relative movement

. Improve Credit VIX case studies

#### 2020-11-09
o Daily with Michael
  - maybe label which firms are in MM program in sheet, so we know who to NOT focus on
  - all volume is not equal! MMs contribute to our revenues, but not to the product ecosystem - bring expertise to the product, chase customers
  - self-clearing indicated by same acroynym in MPID and On Behalf Of
  - On Behalf Of GSCO (Goldman) - for firm (prop trading) or for customers? - need the CTI 4 in that case
  - a field called OEO ID gave us valuable identification (personal emails, etc.) but can't use for business anymore because it's reg info
  - Jump is biggest customer but goes through 8 accounts; firms with fewer accounts each with more volume may be misleading
  - Trading Technologies and other trading software platforms ("ISVs"?) show up in "firms"; Morgan Stanley may contract TT and hand it out to BDIA
  - need context of historical dates for each individual filter (other dimension)
  - Tableau slow - wonder if that's a limitation to how historical we can go at a time
  - Cboe has quote message (1 side vs. 2 side) vs. order message, there is timing difference
  - so these fields are basis for our trading overview, but we also need to look at top of book, for trading potential
  - compare across products - SPX activity VS. VIX activity; look at term structure
  - then... second and third order stuff - VIX futures fair value, etc.

. ask: where is buy or sell data?
x make list of key fields - make Tableau page with that as underlying
  - "what is everything you guys have? here are the 10 things for sure" order transition table? (order hist + trade_hist?)
  - the list: 
x contact Angie Wang and Charlie Barrett
x read on single-stock futures
  - TransTrend is like literally the only people who do single-stock futures lol

o Salesforce overview with Johnny Pesenti
  - set up email sync for client-oriented details
  - search function for literally anything
  - pipeline - qualified interest all the way to closed won
  - data synced with Tableau

x change up board meeting charts
  - look at each one, determine whether it's good

#### 2020-11-10
o Daily with Michael
  - "40Act" - US funds that hold derivatives
  - iBoxx gets around lots of Europe UCITS restrictions
  - potentially better borrow fee embedded in iBoxx futures than your personal one for use with HYG
  - insurance companies case: can't buy corporate bonds until issuance so sit on Treasury futures for month; can beat that with iBoxx futures
  - currently OTC don't have to post margin against dealer bank (e.g. BlackRock and JPM). UMR (Dodd-Frank) will change that this fall (postponed) - mandatory 15% (vs. our 5%)
  - Zurich guy said to Michael and Hemal he has 17bn and he's hedging incompletely with CDX because only it has the notional size
  - OCC cannot clear Euro-denominated products
    - inevitably people are going to suggest clear EU iBoxx on Cboe European clearing instead of waiting for OCC to get Euro capabilities,
      and that's an idea that repeatedly failed according to Michael; need to clear on LCH where real comparable products can offset, cross-margin

x [BLOCK - wait for response on Jira ticket] SEC wants to know 3-3:15pm VIX futures volume by maturity since we switched daily settlement (Oct 26) compare to prior (smaller, but how much)
  - due by Thursday!! volumes for SEC
  - want more than just volumes though - # firms, bids and asks, etc.
  - make sure I can get this historical intraday data myself - easily look at TAS 2:58pm, etc.
x give Pallavi and Danny the updated scaled CDX indices
  - note that historical values are scaled by magnitude to current series - only usable for returns; numbers no longer mean spread

#### 2020-11-11
o Daily with Michael
  - how frequently do we communicate with accounts in Salesforce? need labeling system for who we can target for each product - mini-VIX tag,
    iBoxx tag on condition of some legislation change, etc.
x email Yoshiki, bandwidth spotty next couple months, explain what you owe
. question: why is VIX futures RPC increasing? is it that customer percentage has increased since the November election?
x review Dimitrios info for call tomorrow

#### 2020-11-12
x follow up with Charlie on Tableau usage and on Anna Purna's what does the book look like, spread, etc.
- trading continues after settlement now - 15 minutes
  - how did Eagle7 say that affected them?
  - why does it matter that prices change after settlement - what do they need to mark?
- VWAP settlement is newly proposed for VIX futures, but common in the industry
  - give traders a way to touch the settlement
  - downside is traders now can't immediately point to final quote and say oh midpoint is the settle
    - need indicative/final settlement value distributed in the seconds/minutes after 3pm

o Dimitrios iBoxx Fair Value Meeting
  - offer Dimitrios chance for walkthrough; otherwise, I can start on series of questions on email, methodology doc, spreadsheet cols
  - BlackRock borrow screenshot, from slides Steve Laipply presented a few years back
    - that's the BlackRock borrow rate; Hanweck derives from futures prices implied by options, Bloomberg is something simple
  - process is take Hanweck borrow (proprietary-smoothed), plug it into HYG-total-return-scaled-to-IBXXIBHY where scaling is rolling mean
  - with all this, we're still off ~15 cents front month, ~25 cents second month (spreads half)

x [BLOCK - Dimitrios working on slides] Coordinate deadline for next Wednesday/Thursday for fair value presentation
  - initial meeting on Monday, emphasized target audience needs conciseness and clarity - slides go with a question

. [BLOCK - learn order transition tables] Bob Siverson automation double-check

#### 2020-11-13
o Tutorial with Charlie Barrett
  - dynamic between our groups should be through Jira requests
  - delivered notes on custom time (issue is they waterfall) and rolling means
  - Hue - get set up to use Python to connect, then send SQL queries for data
  - Tableau - visual construction - need to deconstruct Charlie's functions
    - US futures -> top of book
  - Charlie will follow up with emails with resources

#### 2020-11-16
x go through available Tableau visuals ASAP
  - basically there is:
    - "new/usable" stuff (mostly from Charlie Barrett)
    - really old one-offs that now won't even open (Vita)
      - note that a lot of Vita's data came from spreadsheets, not the new data platform
    - stuff from Parth which I didn't really understand
x maker, taker, turner?
x make list of useful Tableau charts, categorize
x go through board meeting charts

. bring up spread visuals - not currently in Tableau reports

o Meeting with Dimitrios and Tiago on IBHY Futures Fair Value Slides
  - my vision: starting point - BlackRock formula - and why we're not satisfied, clear motivation
               brief meat - here's what we did, each step leading to the next; showing off what we did is not the goal - asking questions is
               end: list of questions we're asking via the slides

o Daily with Michael
  - example of Tableau: market maker incentive (mini-VIX and iBoxx)
    - mini-VIX in particular, quote quality incentive
      - MMs: you want us to be 10 cents wide 50% of the time and that's hard! Michael doesn't think so

- idea: liquidity Tableau page
  1) the bid-ask spread, 2) quantity at the top of the book, 3) price impact coefficients (fun to code)
  - TAS is a form of “cream skimming” – skimming off of uninformed order flow.
    This tends to make the order flow in the regular continuous market more toxic, which reduces liquidity in that market.
    For this reason, other cream skimming mechanisms used primarily in equity markets (payment for order flow, dark pools, block trades)
    are frequently criticized. (This is why some regulators, particular in Europe, have attempted to curb such activity and
    force more trading into “lit” venues.)

#### 2020-11-17
o Weekly with Yoshiki
  - "so what's the story"x500
  - Mark Thompson - emerging markets story vs. US and European credit - he's seen banks rally due to term structure steepening, etc.
- forwards are a function of rates and dividends

#### 2020-11-18
o Daily with Michael
  - COT - Commitment of Traders - CFTC document weekly
  - delta in VIX options hedged with VIX futures
  - VIX futures is simply the most liquid thing for vega exposure - watch for that dynamic
  - banks are sell side and end up short VIX futures to hedge options exposure, etc.
  - asset managers are usually just trying to hedge books, so long VIX futures
    - ProShares (and maybe Credit Suisse) are counted by CFTC in this category, so ETPs basically all fall here
  - levered money is basically hedge funds - commonly short VIX futures
    - Ronin, etc. people that blew up
  - spreads - long and short at the same time, so not counted in open interest!
  - LakeView Trading says: 3:30-4pm is now wacky because 3-3:15pm is new post-settle cleanup time; why don't you get rid of it??
  x look at election day - past settlement change, see if flurry of activity caused 3:30-4pm to become useful
    - answer is "no"

- don't go too cute with the visuals in the beginning - literally tables, but completeness matters
- one way to declutter - literally just do it for VIX futures (Ameribor we never want, iBoxx is too small)
  - literally never want cross-product comparisons cause there's only 3 products
- maker/taker/turner - next level - Jump trades a ton, likely taker, but each individual account is doing something different - classify
- OCC needs "drop copy" to even know who's trading TAS - flying blind, wild west in regulation
- but Cboe has risk limits - maybe VIX TAS even independent from regular trading

. [BLOCK - wait for response on Jira] Tableau general pref Michael:
  - click and zoom into day, intraday; then break it down by firm and CTI code, did they buy did they sell?
  - simple summary stats - every firm with CTI 4, how many unique subaccounts, and what is volume number, how does it compared over time
  - Annapurna market level, can we break down to firm/CTI level?
. ask about data platform limitations - how far back can we go in history, compared to the old Oracle tables
. [BLOCK - wait for response on Jira] VIX weekly futures/options
  1) Who is trading VIX weekly futures/options?
  2) What are volumes on VXX weeklies? (in total and by EFID)
  3) How many unique accounts trade each day? (in total and by EFID)
. VIX (can do self)
  1) Average trade size by CTI code
  2) Average order size by CTI code
. [BLOCK - wait for response on Jira] Closing level and daily change for VIX, SPX, IBXXIBHY, HYG, IBXXIBIG, & LQD
  - how do these compare to normal (percentile over the past ???)
  - high/low futures range by maturity
  - number of orders by TPH by CTI type by maturity compare to normal (percentile over the past ???).

x send message to Dimitrios - futures fair value should take precedent over Yoshiki

x [Dennis no response] Pete Smith - Dennis clarification

#### 2020-11-19
- scalping terminology in trading - is it strictly gamma scalping or?
- "minute marker"?

- TAS ideas
  - I couldn't find TAS on Bloomberg
  - look at TAS as percent of market trading - compare to WTI
  - VIX TAS may honestly be a bigger proportion, but look at how much each firm is capable of trading
  - now what actually happened on Feb 5 with TAS - we just hit an upper cutoff, right?
    what was the cutoff, and what is the issue? TAS did not cause anything right?

- Cboe sends opening message before you can send in orders for series - if timing is non-deterministic, that's a disadvantage

- VWAP VIX settlement
  - 2020-01-24/25 switch over to VWAP settlement; stated as 1-minute VWAP right now, but suggestions for 30-second to align with E-mini
  - now (currently) TAS closes at 2:58pm - always 2 minutes prior to settle

- order timestamping
  - stamped when it goes through the order gateway, prior to the matching engine
  - now deterministic - first through gateway, first into ME

- Why don't we combine iBoxx futures into Yoshiki research/content on Credit VIX?
  In case studies, we're saying "Credit VIX would be great to hedge right here, better than VIX,
  if nothing else by leverage because the number is larger", so why don't we throw in iBoxx?

- BlackRock can override prices in iBoxx settlement from IHS Markit
  - 97% Markit prices accepted, but 3% BlackRock puts in prices they believe in - likely minor prices though

- "violate Cboe's spread book"?

#### 2020-11-23
> How do you use Hue??
x look at e-micro vs. e-minis
. details on spread, etc. for MM incentive program especially iBoxx
  - Thomas is the guy, different from Bob Siverson's rebates report (which he sent materials for)
  - see if Bob's stuff has data by firm - not just when it hit the threshold, but like "are they 10 up, 3 cents wide?"
x for fair value, we want the borrow rate to drop out of the equation
  - tell Dimitrios we want to back out borrow rate, include the BlackRock equation in appendix so we can point to it as our back-out formula
x do self-review ASAP

#### 2020-11-24
o Prod Dev Catchup
  - do people actually do borrowing then buy HYG for iBoxx? might not be HYG, might be related future
  - futures traders vs. large bond holders - 2 different ways to go about fair pricing iBoxx
  - why would any long manager use HYG instead of future? it's free pickup of Treasuries for money over HYG
  - Jane Street, Susquehana almost certainly pricing using HYG
  . the roll - what is Litch saying is the issue about that?
  . PPF trade (IBIG>IBHY spread)?
  . "getting indicative 2-ways off them for $50m & $100m in both IBHY & IBIG (so we have an idea who’s at the races and who’s not)"
  . why does Litch have a sheet with various CTIs counting as "customer"? why aren't they just CTI 4
  . literally walk through iBoxx Outline https://wiki.cboe.com/display/GCS/iBOXX+Outline
  - 4-5pm London time - half-hour segments in Sarj's schedule
  - who are the D&I team?

#### 2020-11-25

- Board meeting presentation prep (OKAY THIS WAS WAY OFF)
  - business update looks reasonable, futures financials section is confusing
  - MM incentive program results in the business update for sure
  - otherwise, updating to present seems reasonable?

x change Jira dashboard requests priorities to high low medium

------------------------------------------------
o CFE Business Update (Board Report)

General
- Historical Context
  - want to know historical as far as we can - reset people's expectations for VIX
  - orders sent, average size sent, etc. is customer going up, how does low level activity compare to history
- Conditions are completely different, open interest is smaller, market is not working the way we forecasted
  - need to detail customer activity to prove this (and ETP activity)
- VIX volume has 2 pieces, customer volume and ETPs (volumes and assets), compare historically and say these are an engine for the VIX
- Need insights from firm-level losses in volume (and historical context)
  - heatmapping at firm level could be nice
- Don't worry about ADV target stuff - we're trading 200 contracts, do you think we're hitting the target?
- Fewer images per slide - drive one point across per slide
- consider colors - volumes always being certain color, etc.

Slide 3 - liquidity chart
x need to validate - which firms do the book sizes come from? pick through days and see if they're actually decreasing
  - checked some bid/ask quoting sizes on Bloomberg QR and it checks out - huge permanent quoting crash after March
x take out any slightly suspect spike days, potential systems errors distracting; rolling average for bid and ask sizes since they fluctuate and distract
  - spread data seems problematic - nickel wide except for 3% of days - need to know what happened on those days before throwing them out
x reach out to Annapurna
  - said she would look into questions on what the data means but then didn't respond

Slide 4 - AUMs as an explanation for VIX volume
AUM of ETPs doesn't really matter - it's the activity that moves the needle
update Monday AUMs go to 2018, overlay shares traded - AUM doesn't change much, but activity does dramatically, VIX futures volume as well (should mirror ETP volumes)
message should have been this DOES make a difference, take out TVIX impact minimizing stuff
ETP volume vs. VIX volume in addition to AUM
point out specific dates, Feb 5, XIV change, TVIX delist, SVIXY delevered, etc.
x need XIV, take out Asian for ETP volumes, then break into 2 slides
x take out leverage multiplier in VIX ETP volumes
- add arrow to TVIX - switching from levered to unlevered messes with volumes
okay so we just straight up had to do VIX-equivalent vega volume for ETPs using Michaels old spreadsheet

Slide 5 - iBoxx
unique trading customers, notionals (big room to grow for notional capture)
uh oh, can't match Litch
more distinguishing colors from CTI
highlight record October day - potential
don't mention IBIG since it's not been the focus - record day split them up
Matt would do notional comparison to ETF, we can look at TRS, CDX; here's where it could be here's where we are
*are we not going to replace Matt's total IBHY volume then?

Slide 6 - GTH
reset numbers
highlight GTH especially around election; highlight general events Brexit (referendum did the spike - 3,4 years ago 2016), Trump election, March etc.
by day works better than by month to not gloss over spikes lost in ADV

Slide 7 - Ameribor
do related product notional for Ameribor too - eurodollar, SOFR futures, OTC swap interest rates LIBOR and SOFR (Dimitrios has done DTCC stuff (where OCC stuff is reported), he may have it)
bubbles - Ameribor as a dot

VIX Minis Slides
growth is gonna happen, but what's "big"
regular volumes, show mini VIX-big VIX percent share (no need to show target is 7% or whatever), show retail volume as fraction of total
eventual question: how frequently do people keep trading after the first time? retention rate
take out existing slides  

Top Firms Heatmap
heatmaps - need customer vs. MM
  - interesting note: current bottom 5 are all customer firms
work further back in time, more firms
x try slide with 2019-12 to present

------------------------------------------------

#### 2020-11-26
o Yoshiki
  - Complete the triangle - basis point VIX, percentage VIX, index spread level; spread level context needed with %

o Michael
  > can probably get settlement VWAP trades via Data Platform (T+1, not timely as sek/awk) - that's probably my next step
  - EFID - BATS executing firm ID
  - MPID - equities - member something ID
  - Michael uses "log in" instead, but it's legacy and no one knows what it means
  - Thomas's team is Batch (same as Brett Johnson)
  - LMMs incentive program - counting by millisecond quoting according to qualifications, divide satisfying ms by ms in day
  - IHS Markit is getting bought by S&P
  - Block ECRP - scheduling with Denise and Art for changes? Albert Jiminez is going to present floor mechanics; want to know complications faced by Lakeshore etc. doing on behalf of others
  x Charlie - work towards proposing standing half-hour meeting - easy to cancel

- why are there bounds on TAS?
- 1709583D US Equity is Bloomberg ticker for the VXX ETN that matured 2019-01-30. had to ask Help Desk.

#### 2020-11-27
o Michael Board Report Meeting 2 - notes inline with slides notes 2 days ago

> get Charlie Barrett and literally go through making a new dashboard because things aren't working

> [ONGOING] Charlie Barrett instructional calls
  x1. I'm trying to edit a Tableau sheet and have no idea what just happened, please advise
     - desktop Tableau app - ask EUC
     - we did a very helpful walkthrough but then closed the browser so didn't get to save anything lol
  x2. Tableau administrative stuff - still can't move things around, can't create worksheets
     - reg conflict may get in way of admin access
     - Charlie fixed this by reassigning ownership
  3. How to use Hue - I'm getting permission issues
     - Found Confluence guide for Python API and have Parth's code
  4. Accessing legacy historical data
     - what's the exact difficulty with backfilling new system with old data? why isn't it a one-time conversion for each database?
     - preference is one-time then we have it; we need a solution, direct access, so we can familiarize with what's there
  x5. Learn how your group distributes Jira projects, so I can avoid spamming Jira
     - equities, futures, options, misc.
     - every 2 weeks, sprint meeting
     - what happens when uptake is too much - how do you decide which ones you'll work on this sprint
  6. New daily dashboard - pie charts
    - spread vs. outright, CTI split, clearing type, etc. for adjustable time range
    - want "click through" ability, i.e. if 12% is CTI 1, click it and here they all are
    - heatmaps are good for subsequent firm-level views
  x7. VWAP replication - I'm trying to backtest the new VWAP settlement on historical VIX futures settlement trades, so how/where should I get that data
    - contact Eileen for high-level questions
  8. how to handle alternate sources of data
    - iBoxx/HYG holdings we get via email; we don't want to lose control
    - same with S&P - shouldn't just sit around in an email inbox
    - potential new SPIKES futures Tableau dashboard - what would the data piece be like?
  9. way to look at previous saved versions of a sheet?
  10. what does the "certified" data source mean for us?
  11. what is test vs. non-test? looked at https://wiki.cboe.com/display/DP/Futures+Symbol+Reference+Data but it doesn't explain further

x ask Annapurna: can you do firm-level LMM liquidity stats? maybe even down to sub-account level

x Set up catch-up meeting with Parth
  - can tell from trading activity that firms are trying to replicate ETPs, etc.
  - invite Michael and John as well

#### 2020-12-01
- what happened to mini VIX customer volume on 2020-08-10? 20% of total volume??

- Parth has spreadsheet for ETP VIX futures equivalent volume, and gamma (change in VIX volume based on change in 1 point VIX), and ETP roll VIX volume

- Michael what did you say on the SEC call?

- AUM-based ETP VIX-equivalent-vega volumes
  - scratch_4.py - based on knowledge from Michael's old messy spreadsheet
  - BBG UX1 Index rolls so that it's the future that will mature at the next maturity
    - on the maturity date, it will still be the one settling, which means days to maturity goes 21, 20, ... 1, 0!!!, 22, 21, ...
    - in my code, there is a huge write-up comment on how to weave together 3 nearest UX maturities for the roll

> ask Parth about Tableau OI why it doesn't match - is he checking out with the CFE historical CSV, or doing ETP's equivalent VIX futures OI?
  > list which ETPs he's looking at

#### 2020-12-03
---------------------------------------------------
o Dimitrios iBoxx Fair Value: Clear Capital

- trader says need to account for difference between IBXXIBHY portfolio and HYG portfolio, especially near maturity
- closer to maturity, shorter lookback
- repo for bonds and liquidity premium is big effect on implied borrow rate, that's where borrow rate should come from, not HYG options
- Markit sometimes posts constituents late

Litch:
1) futures are 140, how do I know prices shouldn't be 130 - how close am I to fair value, am I overpaying?
2) options market, TRS on ETF vs TRS on index, how to approximate funding/financing rate that is locked in on TRS? they want the implied borrow

- near settlement, it could have tracked perfectly on every day other than settlement, but uncertainty in tracking near settlement makes 
  liquidity sketchy and ultimately self-fulfilling prophecy.
  - is that a fundamental issue with IBXXIBHY not exactly being HYG?

o Dimitrios iBoxx Fair Value: DV Trading (Zeke)

- HYG is main origin, fair value often below future because hedge point below NAV, bid-ask on corporate bond substantial so
  creation/redemption tough so HYG trading 0.1%-1% above NAV (effective creation fee is ~40 bp says Litch, no technical creation fee)
- iBoxx index published daily, so can check index to see how far off you are; use implied NAV change for HYG and apply it to IBXXIBHY
- bullish over, bearish under NAV

- went on Bloomberg, calculated from bonds to see what IBXXIBHY would be, can look at indicative NAV too
- like half a point of liquidity issue for DV

- literally suggested holding S&P instead of HYG because it would be steadier near settlement

Litch: would it be easier to settle on last day of month instead of first of next month?
- DV Zeke: premium/discount of HYG over NAV moves a lot on certain days that's the issue
  - we think final day of month it moves the most, so it's tough
  - dividend needs to be adjusted for as well (trivial as long as you don't forget)
- okay so portfolio changing towards maturity doesn't matter much - they say just 20 bonds is enough

- those spreading off of corporate bonds are gonna have to be super wide; those spreading off HYG can be tighter
- future generally trades tighter than HYG premium/discount

- ISIN bid and ask from Bloomberg, via BlackRock's pricing
- recall for settlement, BlackRock uses 97% Markit prices, overrides with own on 3%
  - you get the same thing with BlackRock and Markit pricing
- financing cost of bonds: what rates are for the next 2 weeks (3% annualized, then like 15bp for next 2 weeks)
- come up with upper and lower bound for the future
  - upper is spot + financing for being long, lower is spot - borrow cost for being short bond and long future
  - take out the fact that you got cash and can lend it out
  - LIBOR-50bp for lending, LIBOR+50bp for borrowing
- rates are so low, and premium/discount so high that borrow rate is not affecting much
- financing cost is like 8bp even 3 months out now so not much; if close, don't even need to hedge
  - risk is lower as you go to settlement - no worrying about your hedge
- in conclusion: problem isn't calculating fair value, it's just that it's 50bp wide for corporate bonds and premium/discount for HYG
---------------------------------------------------

#### 2020-12-04
o Michael iBoxx Debrief
  - ABN doesn't do cash bonds, but Murray does it for them; SocGen does it too
  - UBS Bondport bond/ETN run by UBS
    - can't be taker on Bondport and maker on iBoxx because trading too close to fair
  - other UBS customers considering iBoxx, but are we potentially competitors to UBS?
  . what is ETF trade at reference price (VolShares)?
  - second month should only trade at like 2 cents, not 6, because HYG to hedge also trades high
  - could you be a corporate bond MM and then just get out via creation/redemption of iBoxx
    - can't give it to BlackRock and they'll pass through "actuals" and do 40bp (no technical creation fee)
    - in hindsight, I don't remember what this bullet meant

- Learning what an ETF is
  - "total cash number" in an ETF is actually a proper term meaning:
    "multiply this by shares outstanding/creation unit shares to get total cash" because fuck you
  - so first off I didn't understand that creation/redemption manages shares outstanding to push ETF share prices back to NAV

- what is the "cash basket"? the IBXXIBHY basket or the HYG trust basket?
  A: IBXXIBHY basket
- consider getting ETF.com holdings for HYG

- difference between IBXXIBHY and HYG - like 25-30 line items bonds, less than 1% of notional (uh, 1% is pretty big?)
- since March, real macro accounts that would otherwise do swaps and stuff, now that Treasury rates markets are wacky, want to do swaps on TLT

. transition Tiago's TWAP iBoxx stuff - find forwarded email

> figure out who should do the VWAP - me or Charlie - what's their status, preferably me
x request Annapurna project on Jira after Charlie call

. proof files have HYG LQD TLT, look at them
  . respond to Sarah Cummings

- iBoxx Tableau page from Pallavi - might have some info on holdings, etc.; quarterly basis broad-based index rules
- Markit portfolio they send every day is not dynamic, it is once a month; Pallavi's rules would help us keep it updated
- "HYG optimized" - intramonth
- HYG NAV is still volatile - it doesn't move with IBXXIBHY toward settlement
> need to track HYG-IBXXIBHY NAV stuff - question: why doesn't it track
. new dashboard, not ready yet - track HYG LQD premium/discount to NAV
  - track difference between IBXXIBHY and HYG

- new dashboard - VIX futures, number of ORDERS we receive by maturity
  - break it down by CTI, type of order (day order, limit order?) etc.
  - also average order size, break it down same way
    - average important because XTX will be like "average is prob 2 lots, retail important! decrease your ticks size!"
      but in reality we need to get average splitting customer and institutional to not get misdirected by HFT; want the true customer
  - goal is to drill down to individual guy and here's his average order size

o Michael
  - legacy Cboe systems
    - quote 2 sided, order 1 sided
    - BATS does not have these restrictions - can send order over quote port 1 side or the other
    - order port cheaper 1gig slower; quote port 10gig
    - Isaacson 1MM bonus story:
      - introduced quote ports to CFE, screwed up market equilibrium to get port fees
      - really affects TAS, now need to fix TAS algo to not let Wolverine beat Virtu every single time

x finish self-review
x figure out vacation rollover

- multiplier effect of VIX futures: once it gets to a certain level, people trade product not for its fundamentals but for price betting

x VWAP project: pick 3rd or 4th term and get VWAP and check it against current midpoint prices (all available in CSV files, but must be settlement prices in some database)

#### 2020-12-08
o Parth Futures Work
  - 3 big categories
    - VIX ETPs
    - VIX futures (summary tables)
    - mini VIX
------------------------------------------
ETPs
- investigated regulatory cap on ETP-roll volume - leverage may be limited "floating leverage" 10%
  - very little effect is the conclusion
- Parth's done VWAP too
- Parth's done the vega ETP shares
- identified all accounts trading for Fubon
- swap contracts, Credit Suisse with Millenium, had to adjust 2015-2016 open interest
- "sensitivity analysis" is the gamma stuff
- ETP details

VIX Futures
- split to every single firm
- don't know user if clearing is same as user firm - something to do with whether it's TPH or not - non-TPH users must be accounted for manually
- manual - account user mapper (like Litch)
- non-TPH summary files
- OCC member directory - get clearing firm code
. schedule separate call for code methodology of strategies
- VXM strategies different from VX even for same users - can't find any pattern for 95% cases
  - VXM seems to be for hedging
- find explicit definition of customer vs. firm - Parth will send memorandum with CTIs

Mini VIX
- for each clearing firm calculating open interest, price, weighted price, profitability - total profit for every day every account
- P&L summary table - sum non-TPH, TPH and get 0, so you know you're accounting for everything
- Jump scalping taking affecting Charlesworth who is maker; takers eating makers in P&L
- CTI 3 shouldn't exist in futures at all LOL
- taker is taking bid or ask; maker is not - discriminate by checking if they're selling at bid, buying at ask, etc.

- our immediate needs, can ping Parth
------------------------------------------

. [BLOCK - I need to see what he's sent] asking Parth to make index for easily usable summary Excel files

. talk to Parth about US Futures Tableau stuff
  . ask Parth about Tableau OI why it doesn't match - is he checking out with the CFE historical CSV, or doing ETP's equivalent VIX futures OI?
    . list which ETPs he's looking at

#### 2020-12-09
o Jenn
  - EFID
    - firms can have infinite EFIDs
    - each EFID gets the logical port - actual logins into CFE
    - 550 for the first, 2-9 are more expensive on fee schedule
      - over 26, only Jump, 100 apiece
    - get TPH, auto get EFID assigned - can specify 4 letters you want, but some don't care and get random
    - EFID is physical manifestation of your TPH
    - logical port is now called "order match capacity allocations"
  - MPID
    - market participation ID, NASDAQ uses it, CFE shouldn't really be using it
    - created by Kathy Drew, so maybe terminology disconnect

x Pallavi/Stabilis Squad TLT MDs

#### 2020-12-11
o iBoxx Litch
  - PPF is pseudo-governmental obsolete pension-buyer, has been bravely using VIX

o Bob Siverson
  - Michael wants to merge LMM and DPM obligations
    - Thomas will grab the data and we can determine if DPMs are meeting the quoting obligations
    - web tool to set up LMM (get EFID for LMM), no such thing for DPM
  - Michael's Variance product breakdown:
    - DRW gets special treatment and effectively created its own incentive program for variance
    - vega notional risk being taken on is how margin works in variance
      - 100k vega, then that's average
        - note it's a long convex product, so long variance gains more on up move than loses on down move:
          102k gain up, 97k loss down - P&L of 1 vol point change
    - quoted in vega, margin from vega notional; was 2x vega, but people got blown up in March (Malakite), now 2x-3x (200-300k notional as margin)
    - Malakite lost 800MM selling extreme tails, were big assholes anyway according to Michael
    - don't have capital to put up those margins, become illiquid
    - this is all OTC, btw; our listed margins on 1-month contract are 13-15x vega, probably higher now because of March
    - complaints about Cboe contract expensive, but some people felt the flexibility to not go back to counterparties is worth it
    - we need to work with OCC on margin models - don't treat variance as independent from SPX and VIX!
      - bigger margins to use variance contract than to straight up replicate variance
      - "stan" model? there's been deployment at one level, not at the second, every year they're saying variance model will change... but lots of hurdles
        - replacing Encore with Renaissance, so now nothing's going to be done until 2022
    - Eurex did a lookalike with EuroStoxx with good margins and it doesn't trade, so not looking optimistic
      - but then again, VIX was also a a very OTC product that blew up
    - variance has been around in some form or other since VIX
    - if you go out 6 months, margins are competitive... decays into like 30x ratio which looks bad but is actually small
    - convoluted variance units vs. vega terminology conversion $8 per $1 vs. $2500 per point (or something)
    - "line-by-line liquidity" in SPX already doesn't exist! we're not losing that from variance replacing it in VIX settlement
    - not clear what the effect on 16.20 is from SPX trading, whereas variance would literally show you moving the number
  - different accounts for same firm all count towards LMM incentive and that's intentional - Jump is poster boy

o Michael Check-In
----
what I'm working on, if asked:
  - wrap up BlackRock - respond to Sarah Cummings, look at iShares proofs
  - tackle VWAP replication
  - Tableau - submit 2 more dashboards - pie chart, SPIKES futures - discuss what the data piece will be like (send heads up to Charlie after, ask him to notify once people pick up the slew of dashboards)
  - Tableau - building on what I learned last week, read Parth's stuff
  - potentially GZAP knowledge transfer to Pallavi/Dimitrios/Danny so they can generate figures like in the S&P webinar slides
  - set up call with Sarj
----
  - convert Parth stuff into stuff that I can monitor
  - convert Michael's slides charts into things to monitor
  - bi-weekly basis exec meeting update
  - TAS timing discussion
    - ProShares says:
      - inverse, levered ETPs don't have static rebalance based on daily settlement.
      - within VWAP window, heighted gamma, most risk around movement in daily settlement price in that 30-second window
      - can go from rolling 10k contracts to 12k based on where that number ends up
      - preference is to use TAS to counter, so would like TAS to run all the way through, as it's more efficient
        - otherwise, have to use 3-3:15pm window to finish the trading, and no one wants that
    - Virtu in agreement - run TAS through VWAP
    - Pankaj disagrees, says:
      - any rule volatility around VIX gets eyeballs, reputational risk; we don't want TAS to get anymore eyeballs
      - ProShares's scenario of big move in VWAP calc window?
        first 10 seconds, it seems like 11k contracts, then price is pushed down and they only need 9k...
        are they seriously suggesting they'll sell 2000 after 10 seconds? surely they're not actually adjusting second to second
    - we're going back to ProShares to get clarification on this raised point
    - but it's 100% either 1) TAS up to VWAP or 2) TAS all the way through
  - VWAP will be last 30 seconds, to match SPX e-minis

x DUE Thursday 2020-12-17
  - give Michael report on timeline/draft on what type of report we're hoping to see
  - have a narrative for the "report" - take that advice from the slides
  - sources
    - Michael's slides
    - our 7-8 Jira tickets
    - Parth's ready-to-go (simple) data
BRAINSTORM
- 

. review Pallavi FAQ
x send Dimitrios slides to Prod Dev Catchup
x talk to Annapurna about Tableau project status

- Tableau learning
  - hierarchy "drilldown" vs. clicking top thing and having 2 additional panes below showing details
  - someone from the Tableau company reached out to me

. [ONGOING] Aggregate general questions for Michael (everything in this sheet with a ?)
  x ask Michael for location of COT file on CFTC site
  x variance for odd lots (VAO)? (against standard, TAS, variance (VA))

#### 2020-12-16

. Charlie ask
  - how to get historical data right now - data piece is 100% necessary, other stuff is luxury
    - how to get further back for VWAP??
  - vega volumes? have you guys done this?
  - if you just wanted to export data from Tableau, how would you do that
  - want to make new chart that is 1 if numbers don't match, 0 if numbers do?
  - CFE OI + Settlement Values, 1) where does data come from in relation to data dictionary, 2) difference between "price" and "close"
  - dealing with dates - convert to string to avoid the default date drilldown hierarchy?
  - CFE OI + Settlement, VX, Trade Date 2020-02-27, Expire Date 2020-03-25, there are 2 weeklies only different on "Calculation Method" and "Issue Type"
  - how do I visualize stuff like "15 Minute Increment"

- list things we want to see across time
- OCC symbol volume - Tableau
  - order fill will get these for new

data written from trading systems to production tables
DP picks up production table data
Tableau tables used to contacts
that is, you can't pull CFE Order Fill with Reference Data, it's a join of like 4 DP tables
firm ID is the port owner
clearing firm is the EFID
on behalf of is the executing firm (TPH, may not own a port, but they were the ones who wanted to trade)
firm_sub_id is the exact port - Silexx marks ports

- Parth ask prep
  - what's your workflow with Hue and Python queries
  - ideas for daily trades between 2:45pm and 3pm
  - send over list of data sets for Parth to pull
  - pull 3 futures terms to get M1 M2
  - send partial data ASAP if we can

#### 2020-12-17

o Parth
  - 2018-02-25 was migration day for futures
    - 2018-03-20 earliest we can get in Tableau though - there is a gap that must be filled by Paresh from production tables
  - 2019-10-07 was migration day for options
  - SIF trade data gets ETPs. what is that?
  - for VWAP Parth got me...
    1) Y:/Research/Research1/Parth/Fudon Project/Input Data/Raw Data (SAS Pulled)/Futures Cleared Trades/ for legacy data 2009-01-02 to 2018-02-23
    2) Y:/Research/Research1/Parth/Fudon Project/Input Data/Raw Data (Tableau Pulled)/Tableau Raw Data Contra Futures/VX/ for modern data 2018-03-20 to present
    2.5) Y:/Research/Research1/Parth/Fudon Project/Input Data/Raw Data (Tableau Pulled)/Tableau Raw Data Contra Futures/VXM/ for Minis modern data 2018-08-10 to present
  - for VWAP Charlie got me...
    3) futures_trades_missing_final.csv (temporarily stored in Downloads) for makeshift production tables data 2018-02-26 to 2020-03-19

#### 2020-12-18

- VWAP data notes
  - 2014-10-01 what the hell no volume 2:45pm-3pm?
  - modern data 2020-07-06 appears as trade date for 7/3, which seems like an error, but this is how they record (known by Michael)
  - oh my god, need to investigate the 3 data pieces. also need to do VWAP this weekend. god damn

o VWAP
  - record number of trades for each day in addition to the VWAP number
  - includes complex orders legging in, but excludes complex vs. complex executions. (legging in is spread order executing against 2 simples?)
  - corrections are handled iff they happen during the live VWAP - extremely, negligibly rare
  - big VIX # contracts x10 to get proper weighting

#### 2020-12-22

o Michael
  - spread vs. outright explanation with math and numbers from SMARTS
  - note that VIX is nickel ticks!
    so 2.5, 7.5 on settlement midpoint, even 5, but if there are trades that are backfilled as 4 or 3 etc., that's TAS
    - or executed against spread book. it's definitely TAS if it's all the same price throughout the day.
    - our weird data is DEFINITELY TAS. asking Charlie to put a TAS filter on the production tables data
  - TAS gets ordered on T-1 (what does that mean lol) might be a day off somehow
  - implied spread - from resting on bid and offer of non-complex book
  - spread legging in and out of outright - how to figure that out - maybe ask Parth

- evaluate 2:45-3pm numbers again to see if TAS helps
- well, legacy is approximately half the magnitude of missing and modern, which match exactly;
  legacy apparently only does one side of the contra; see test_1_final.csv and test_2_final.csv
- match up non-TAS overlap days and see what the deal is (sort by expiry this time as well, huh)
- stitch into mega along with mini-VIX, split into segments: 1) legacy, 2) transition, 3) modern pre-mini, pre-settle change, 4) modern pre-settle change, 5) modern
- check for monotonic in mega_df: done. good.

- missing's sum of sizes match modern's exactly, but precise times are off - the breakdown is not the same. they are grouping the orders differently, but nothing is being left out

- by firm is always 2-sided, but by order is not necessarily? keep this in mind
- busted trades - watch that for small differences like 10

- OCC not open but we are, so that explains July 3rd held to July 6th trade date
- Good Friday also had an issue one time because unemployment got released and we made a special case
- half-days: Christmas Eve, Day after Thanksgiving, July 3rd if 4th falls during week; how we handle them could be affected by day of week

#### 2020-01-05

- for Annapurna:
  - reframe volume over total volume to be more relevant
  - CTI code so we know how much is Goldman firm vs. Goldman customers
  - biggest/average order size highlight? order size instead of executed size because only a small amount is executed; need CTI as well to isolate customers

- data platform - complex==False should do it, but what about busts and adjusts (basically never happen, but still, are they in DP)?

o SMARTS
  - KCLS is Virtu
  - KCG was prop trading who blew up 5 or 6 years ago.
    put in code on weekend and didn't check ended up buying tons of stock, capitalized 5 billion dollars, dead and bought by Virtu
  - IOC is immediate or cancel - responsible for a lot of 1 lots, in iBoxx is prob trading against HYG quickly
  . investigate SMARTS filtering

- Michael has in mind an old un-findable Vita report as an example of drilling down into VIX volumes
- how can we make website faster
- user interface - sliding to see rest of window is bad, can't freeze panes like in Excel
x suggest we briefly walk through at a very early stage because user interface is super important to Michael

. iBoxx TWAP from Tiago, we need to work on this
  - he's using NBBO (confirm whether it's Cboe or NBBO actually), 15 minute intervals, running on monthly basis, very manual
  - we want to see it more frequently, at smaller increments
  . get this to data team as a project
  - average notional available at bid or ask is the info we get from this, for customers
  - we also want book depth, even though building the book is onerous
  - if our avg is 3 cents wide, 1.2MM at the touch (bid or offer), and ETF is penny wide, 1.5MM,
    there are comparisons we need to make: $88 product vs. $144 product (convert to basis points);
    how far back do we have to go in the book to get to $1.5MM? on both the bid and the offer sides

- FUT-137 is Hemal and Litch's iBoxx education thing for Gina
- GZAP vs. Tableau

- looks like VIX settlement to 3 decimal places until December 2014...

- talk to Dimitrios about next steps iBoxx

- in doing VWAP I had to update a bunch of functions in my modules library (that's now part of GZAP), and it made me think that
  a selling point of GZAP/Python is being able to use functions we've written.
  e.g. functions for deriving VIX expiries, converting BBG tickers to months, generating BBG ticker, etc.

- 2019-12-27 sets a record - it's the only date where there were 10 expiries capable of VWAP (2020-01-22 to 2020-10-21)

#### 2020-01-06

o Dimitrios
  - Michael wants chart that compares levels of Credit VIX with implied vol (or first, ATM IV) calculated from HYG options/LQD options
  - could send him my code? no he doesn't need
  - so Credit VIX BP version should be comparable to ETF VIX/MD BP versions
  - Yoshiki says Bloomberg has IVs - I'm not familiar, might need guidance from him
next steps: Dimitrios will make list of values needed from that super technical total return index doc; I think all will be obtainable
            from the iShares website file, but we'll see. email file was not so helpful because we couldn't piece PCF number to actual constituent.

- HYG changes throughout the month, iBoxx doesn't - that's why constituents difference matter between HYG and IBXXIBHY
x Michael says iBoxx is far and away the more important - have an estimate for deadline
x message Dimitrios
x message Charlie, warn him of Michael hopping on 15 minute call

x VWAP: modern subset vs earlier in history
x pick some big recent days and examine in modern data to see how price moved

#### 2020-01-07

- CFE Fee Schedule - tearing down tiers for 2022 because MMs don't know until end of month which tier they're in
- for iBoxx, Goldman's not going to be aggressive, will be reactive; Credit Suisse might actually make it a business for their customers

. Tanalee reg thing

. Michael sent an email on Monday (or didn't) - keep in mind CFE summary newsletter, put it in for goals, target beginning of April

. do TLT MD stuff but for HYG and hand it to Pallavi/Dimitrios

o Arianne Business Goals Alignment
  - Arianne's sales team incentives - yet another reason we need to have quick stats on customer pie chart, etc.
  - Michael not crazy about anything having to do with LMMs quote quality, anything not related to new customers
  - to track quote quality, every millisecond they track EFIDs, but Thomas is just tracking yes or no
  - scenario possible in derivatives is that a customer trading through Goldman could be doing big numbers, and we don't know which salesperson to credit/punish
  - got to account for RPC - if an MM is generating negative RPC, someone's going to want to push them away, but the coverage person will suffer
  - WH Trading - signed up for all the incentive programs, did it for a bit and then left - coverage person is screwed

- FCMs - Futures Commission Merchant. JP Morgan, etc.
- what is sub ID? multiple for same sub-account, so is it spreads vs. outrights?
- on Wednesday, 3 sub-accounts did 20k/30k from JPM, and JPM was 30k/500k contracts;
  we need to track the sub-accounts through history to see who these big shots are

- remember it's 35-40 names that are excluded from HYG every month for iBoxx

x respond to Pallavi after figuring out daily vs. monthly constituent change difference

- pandas "frequency string"

#### 2020-01-12

o Charlie's CFE Activity Trades Dashboard
  - (solved) how do I get sums for just one day? filtering dates still seems scary because there is filter to the right
    but also a "timeframe"
  - delayed "apply filter" button, since dataset is huge and takes a long time
  - takes too long so default to only VIX
  - maybe account and operator should be switched
  - how to adjust size of columns?
  - Michael's points
    - focused on a single product at a time
    - customer percentage over total
    - can hide away TAS and other subcategories
    - can even hide contras with summary, then click through to see all the individual contras
  - Charlie: if we need refined data, there are faster ways than going through this spreadsheet

. GTH stuff - liquidity after getting details from Annapurna
x look into trade % in GTH

. VXM SWAT update - check in with Michael a lot to track set of updates
  - Arianne wants quote quality
  - heatmap who's been there
  - high level, work way down
  - Jane Street, etc., what did they do? compare to big VIX activity - usually long in one... (Jump goes home flat every day);
    open interest - MM holding it against VIX future maybe
  - retail
  - GTH vs. RTH: Asian hours, European hours, etc.
. do the exact same but for iBoxx

- VWAP
  - think about 2 cents in context of nickel ticks - we should be considering 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 cents differences
  - track how often VWAP ends up outside of bid and ask?
  - look at bid and ask movement in final 30 seconds, that's a completely different driving force behind midpoint settlement

x bid and ask chart, add trade markers, turn volume into bars
- VWAP lets trades spread out over the VWAP period - that's an absolute good thing over midpoint where people rush in the final secs!
- options market makers, TAS traders, ETP guys all in there
. also want to investigate Annapurna's liquidity data source for bid and ask sizes
- visual charts price-size lag is a due to my resampling - I've since adjusted the size of the bars for time over which I aggregate

. trade summary profile on VWAP: for 30 second interval, who's trading how much?

. initial board report packet through end of December
. QBR - can do more in-depth

o iBoxx Fair Value
  - meet with Dimitrios ASAP, next Tuesday update
  . also need to generate HYG MD IFF it's needed
  . need to confirm different file types' "market values" correspond (there will be new constituents, but need to ensure
    continuity for carry-over constituents)
  . cash payment field in underlyings file - can I replicate it?? explore individual holdings for HYG

o Stuart Barton VolatilityShares
  - TAS will go all the way through VWAP - traders may still need to use TAS as the VWAP develops
  - Stuart VolatilityShares ETF has a TWAP that they settle to, so watch out for that
  - levered, dynamic guys at ProShares need to do drastically different volumes at the close as the settle VWAP develops - need TAS

. check Annapurna's and Charlie's WIP dashboards
. follow up with Annapurna on liquidity issues - you sent an email and she didn't respond

- Matt Levine, Bloomberg Opinion columnist

o QBR brainstorm
  - SPIKES - volume, OI, COT info (if any); and market quality stats (if any).
    we should also create a fee/spec/clearing member comparison between the two products
    - lmao 80% discounted fees??
    - they got a futures vs. securities exemption in Minneapolis
  - only talk about 4th quarter
  - think about - how many Goldman CTI 4 accounts have traded in this quarter? how does that compare
  - average order/execution size? is it fewer people trading, or smaller size
  - heatmap - less granular and further back; try quarters;
    correspond top and bottom heatmaps so people can see what 50 percentile is, etc.
  - has universe of particpants shrunk? or is it same universe less volume? firm by firm look is what we want
  - also, throw in VWAP, maybe TAS stuff for Stewart (show volumes before and after settlement change)?
  - slide on upcoming Tableau permanent features

----
So for QBR, I need:
Volume and OI - 'cfevoloi.csv' - https://www.cboe.com/us/futures/market_statistics/historical_data/
Execution Size - the mega dataset?
Order Size - ??? no goddamn way lmao - long term project with Charlie
(alternative to mega dataset for VIX) - 'CFE_Firm_Monthly_ADV_data.csv' (heatmap), try going to quarters to highlight 2020 Q4 - CFE Dashboard
iBoxx - 'iBoxx_Daily_Volume_data.csv' (size/2 is volume) for CTI inspiration - modifying Daily iBoxx Dashboard, 'Current_Open_Interest_and_Volume_by_Futures_Root_F_data.csv'- modifying CFE Dashboard, Full Data - ideally replace with cfevoioi.csv; note, for dataset pulled noon 2020-12-01, 11/30 OI was actually bigger than it should have been according to cfevoloi, not sure why it hadn't updated by the next day; holy shit cfevoloi doesn't have IBHY OI for first 2 months for some reason FUCK
VXM - 'Volume_by_Trading_Session_data.csv' (gives us trading session over 'iBoxx_Daily_Volume_data.csv', nothing else) - modifying VXM Dashboard
Liquidity - 'Near_Term_Futures__data (1).csv' - Liquidity Dashboard
GTH - 'Volume_by_Trading_Session_data (3).csv' - modifying VXM Dashboard
- want to do quarterly comparison to previous quarters
----

. sort out TLT vs. HYG storage vs. MBB (remember the text files)
  - holy shit the early HYG files are insane

- VWAP analysis bid and ask not perfect - can see trade dots in the middle
  . those could be spreads? but also need clarity on if bid/ask is right before or right after trade

x ask Parth to send data pull code
  - eventually try setting up automated email with VWAP?

x reply Dimitrios and Danny

o VXM overview brainstorm
  - look at % customer volume
  - % relative to overall VIX volume
  - highlight customer side - how many FCMs have customer orders coming in
  - for the retail guys, zoom in; e.g. TD on average has 23 customers entering orders, average order/execution size is [blah]
    - retail guys: Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, TSTA, E-Trade, Tastytrade - check with Michael
  - number of unique accounts from TD and IB is smaller in mini-VIX than in big VIX; near term goal should be to overtake
  - put it in context of first 6 months of the product (percentiles)
  - Commitment of Traders (CoT, COT) - need at least 20 accounts to net minimum (200 contracts), point that out as goal for mini-VIX
    - location: CFTC -> Historical Compressed -> Traders in Financial Futures, filter to "E", which means "CFE"
  - generally, Michael really wants an even higher level overview above Charlie's drilldowns
    - pie charts with CTI, etc., high low range, percentile in history (price, price change, high-low range)
  - VVIX is VIX of VIX? 21-day realized vol always nice to whip out; emphasize implications for risk premium;
    VIX at 70 or 80 is a screaming short, even if you have to spend money rolling, put them on that same graph
  - cfevoloi CSV helpful, budget numbers from daily reports finance team

  - "number that we like to tout is how many unique customers have traded the product..."
  - you'll want to note the approximate ratio between unique active accounts and volume - it's about 10 contracts per account
  - this other sheet is hopefully something you've never seen before - # of new (i.e. never before seen) accounts appearing each day

o Dimitrios iBoxx Fair Value
  . figure out capping
  . figure out payments!!!
  . base market value - try to compute from market value

x before 3:30, or 4-4:30, call Michael
  - dug into raw trades CSVs and tracked 2020-09-03 LCWT buying in VWAP (and after period) after selling TAS to close out flat

o Thomas Rouffiac Interview
----
hi Thomas, my name is Gaibo, and I currently work as an analyst in the CFE, the futures part of the Cboe business.
Until a couple months ago, I worked in Product Development, which I'm sure you'll hear me reference quite a bit.
CFE has a bunch of salespeople for pushing the products, but my boss Michael Mollet and I are basically the 2 figuring out how things should be run.
A lot of my current job involves doing data deep dives to come up with insights into how to grow the VIX product suite, as well as our other new initiatives.
We can go over some of my current project later if you're interested: iBoxx fair value based on HYG constituents, ETF option VIX + basis point version, general charts for monitoring VIX

For context, a lot of this is going to revolve around your Python experience. As I mentioned, everything we do revolves around data;
we used to be pretty agnostic, but a couple years ago we just said why not Python. Your resume says you have a CS minor and Python experience,
but I'm gonna want to know more. By the way, pandas/numpy is like 90% of what we do.

so off the bat, I want to tell you your resume is very impressive, and you def come from a different background than I did (data, research), so I feel sort of unqualified to ask you about some of these things.
it sort of seems like you are overqualified for a different job, fund manager. so first question is, what is it that makes you interested in Cboe, in context of all this investment strategy experience?

product development - bring a product from conception through to listing and actively trading. that means talking to market participants for
minutia details on how they would trade, market regulations, evaluating data technicalities, prototyping the index calc, publishing it
collaborating with production coders, marketing it to traders with newsletters and such to get the volumes going
----

x email Michael+Arianne about Thomas
x reverse big diffs chart, add "by month", send to the people
x cancel with Jenn and Litch for this week
x send ETP volumes AND futures equivalent volumes to Debbie Koopman
. get number of unique accounts trading VIX by CTI code by TPH by month (back to 2018); also, average order size; that will be basis for all the marketing stuff

. iBoxx exploration

#### 2020-01-19

x Stuart TAS by 15 minutes

x read through Parth's Data Platform code

. look at Parth's VIX futures work and see if he's already tracking this stuff
  - also did he ever send the index for his futures work?

#### 2020-01-20

o Michael
  - short interest in VIX ETPs: NASDAQ used to report this
    - "NASDAQ short interest report" - VXX primarily used as shorting instrument 50%+ sold short
    - brokers have to report they have lent shares to listing exchange, but now that they've switched ARCA, AMEX to Cboe, we don't track that anymore lmao
    - would be interesting to look at short ratio before and after COVID March
    - think of short guy shorting VXX, if VIX spikes, he's gotta get out and will trade a ton of VIX futures, making our volumes spike
    - TVIX had extreme amounts of short interest, and it had leverage lol; people were scrambling to get out of there
  - Danny Jisa spreadsheet, iBoxx rolls, want to put that in to Data Analysis team
    - 2021-01-12 Michael forwarded to me
    . Dennis has this right now, check in with him

0. intern
1. QBR/board report

#### 2020-01-21

- so the 2018-03 to present "modern" dataset is absurdly large - 50gb in memory. I tried to save it to disk for easy
  recall, but it gave memory error. there was not even enough memory to do groupby() or split TAS from non-TAS. it is
  just slightly too large for any kind of use. note that a subset of that data with trade size and price but no firm ID/contra
  is usable and was used for VWAP. it just blows my mind that a few extra columns caused all this.
  - numbers are very small in memory, but strings are apparently huge
    - inclusion of all those firm codes and names took a lot of memory, 6-8gb per column
  . must change approach to calculating per day and aggregating the rows in memory only - no slick groupby

. oh SHIT Annapurna's order routers have number of orders and total order volume, so we can do the average order size!!!
  - but can't get distribution of order sizes this way...

. prompt Parth for data index

> ask Charlie about working with huge databases for order size
  > Firm Id vs. Mpid vs. Sub Id vs. ("Name" vs. On Behalf Of); is Mpid the same as On Behalf Of?? The latter has been what I consider "the actual people behind the trade", while the firm is just the member platform (Trading Technologies)
    - also, "firm Mpid" vs. Mpid in CFE Order Fill lmao
    - also, "parent firm Id"
  > how to compare when 2 columns are entirely the same (I often want to make sure I'm only deleting redundant things)
  > see unique possible values quickly?
  > why some calculated fields only allow "edit copy" not edit original?
  > walkthrough difference between the 2 CFE Dashboard OI sheets
  > is there way to run Python code directly in the cloud? - want distribution of order sizes
  - lmao there are so many obviously duplicated fields in Daily iBoxx Dashboard; note that "Account " is ironically TRIM([ACCOUNT]), which appears twice
    - "TAS" is a subset of "Product Type". Product Type is nice and inclusive of every VIX product type
  - "Tableau" databases (maintained) vs. "the ones that appear on Hue": how to pull from the first which is the better one
  - Issue type: "R" (iBoxx, XBT) vs. "S"
  - "enabled", "calculation method", "price" (appears to be price on the settlement price on Bloomberg)
  - modern: open interest off by a day from Bloomberg - BBG's 1/28 is Settlement Tableau's 1/27; so is Tableau's OI at end of trading day, and BBG sets it as beginning of trading day?
  - historical: OI and volume are off from Bloomberg - who's right?
  - how to even set the columns??
  - how to rearrange order of filters

. ask Michael how to fix CFEVOLOI iBoxx OIs
  - send to Doug Luzzi

- think about having Excel set up to receive an overwritten sheet
- customer percent in GTH vs. RTH
- how many unique customers? (VIX) add into customer share chart
  - good use case of that new data-pull Tableau sheet made from Daily iBoxx lol
- sheer number of orders (customers) on given day (use Annapurna order routing), can then expand into average order size
- volume just for the GTH segment (maybe break into stacked bars, with Asian, European, US)
- potentially define 2 to 8:30 as European, not 7:00
- for VIX Liquidity, don't wash out the point by including too much history; whole thing or 9 months to show we're doing better, leave out
- replicate VIX points above with VXM
- don't forget to add VWAP and settlement time change

- [SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS] send meeting with Dimitrios and Dennis, cancel potential meeting with Litch

- OH SHIT PIVOT TABLES IN EXCEL LMAO
  - LEARN MORE ABOUT GENERAL TABLES?
  - CREATE PIVOT TABLES FOR MICHAEL INSTEAD OF PYTHON
  - ues the ExcelCampus macro for auto-refresh Pivot Tables; combined with Tables having intelligent detection of additional rows, this is essentially auto-update

- for Board Report, don't forget vega volumes; plus do simple and VIX equivalent ETP stuff

#### 2021-01-25

. 12/31 paycheck, why is there a $1060 company match? - is it a true up? but where's the missing $353.33, since including 12/31 there are 4 missing contributions?

- new accounts each month

- iBoxx
  - dashboard
  - unique accounts (especially ongoing - want new accounts per month) needs to be done in Python
    - need this for everything, especially VIX!

. average order size

. iBoxx Tableau bid-ask TWAP (compares with ETF)
  . investigate from Tiago first to understand
    - NBBO or Cboe source?
  . right now only top-of-book, but we want to say "5 ticks deep in order book, here's how much you can do"
    - would have to push Eileen's group to take on rebuilding the book, which they've been reluctant to do
  . submit to Data people for a visual

. Litch call - pull intraday stuff for insights
  - what our ADV is through to day of
    * 1) show notionals
    * 2) show awful chart on IBHY volumes with focus on CTI 4 - just under 10% of volume, so 1000 ADV in CTI 2 vs. 100 ADV in CTI 4
        - boom-and-bust volumes day to day - ADV looks okay, but it's weird day to day
  - literally, has it gone up, has it gone down? what about HYG/LQD
    * 3) not too much movement in HYG/LQD recently
    * want price/price change as percentile in history
  - correlation of iBoxx returns vs. HYG
    * 4) check these charts - emphasize need to be adjusted for settlement - settlement day data is bad
  - Pallavi's dashboard - ping her to update it?
  - liquidity
    * 5) stable since July - 3 cent spread in IBHY, 5-10 size on bid and ask, 4 cents in IBIG, average 5 size on bid and ask
    * def want to see beyond top-of-book though, we're working on numbers for how much notional you can do for how much shift in spread, so stay tuned
      - "large-scale" liquidity (>$50MM notional) - can we assure that that's doable? at least compared to HYG's bid ask shift?
  - recent activities
  - "what do we want people to focus on right now?"
  - implied roll yield - based on current roll market, 7 cents @ 8, 7 cents as percentage of underlying price is small; annualized, rolling to next month; what's the percent of roll cost?; measuring over 4-5 day window year expiry could be the time range, but there's an art to it; try Yoshiki book?
    * 6) working on this
  - volatility as percentile in history
    * 7) will work on this
  - Treasuries, HYG options, and CDX vs. iBoxx?
  - strip into credit + interest exposure of iBoxx

. VIX - VWAP Tableau dashboard - historical comparison sheet, pick day/maturity to look at last 30 second progression, see if we can get day of instead of T+1, click through to see firm/account/CTI volumes
  - CSMI feed read internally for T instead of T+1, ask Charlie

. mentally catalogue all the questions we can answer with data in current Tableau dashboards
  . next time go through my "on deck" list of new dashboard, not on Jira yet
    - send them templates

x send Michael the 3 remaining slides

- apparently there's no easy way to do Excel slicers for changing aggregation mode
  - an idea is to add sub-columns indicating "sum" or "average", then pivot on those to slice on them. just seems like a kludgy way to do something that should have been built-in

- contact Dennis about the iBoxx roll spreadsheet

- Danny Jisa requests materials to be made available, so that's good

- check price of HYG vs. NAV of HYG correlation - how much does it break down

x Margolis Singapore and Taiwan

- Michael's point: route to make-take exchange or to SIG, etc. TD gets paid; why would they educate their retail investors about VXM?
- Susq stays $5 wide and narrows if you tell them what you want

x iBoxx firm-level # of accounts spreadsheet

x send data for liquidity so Michael can muck
x VXM and IBHY new accounts coming in over time

- to get unique new accounts per day,
  - first aggregate size by date, CTI, firm, account - eliminating "operator" and trade type
    - this ensures every row is unique
  - need to know "known" set of accounts prior to each trading day, which accumulates each day
  - pandas .isin() is handy for giving us a column of True/False for "is it in the set of knowns?"
  - need another field to track number of unique accounts trading per day I think, because Excel is notoriously bad at unique aggregation
    - NOPE, if you use Power Pivot, it has "distinct count". regular Pivot doesn't lmao
  - need code for figuring out whether accounts have changed CTI
    - in VXM on 2020-08-10, RJO's MDG account/operator used 4, which is clearly wrong; next day, their Asian and European still used 4, third day all had switched to 2

- Litch writes "subacct id" for accounts, "mpid" different from "on behalf", "on behalf" expanded by "affl firm"
  - MPID "SHMR" handles customers DV, Tanius, and Virtu (Virtu uses KCLS as "on behalf")
    - is MPID clearing firm or executing firm?

x Singaporean accounts - where did you get that list?
  - some numbers are wrong
  - lmao the total percent calc is wrong???
  - do notionals

- for delisted things on Bloomberg - FSRC (Fund Screening) is the way to go
  - go to bottom, change Market Status from "active" to "delisted", go to top to select Fund Type ETP, etc.

. find settlement data source for futures reference to replace Bloomberg

. reach out to Dennis about roll yield

. can't do Pivot Table on a Pivot Table? (aggregate volume by day, then want average volume per day on month scale)

. data to update (currently through Jan 19):
  - Mini VIX
  - slide 7 (QBR) 3 panels (volume & OI, ETP vs. VIX futures, big one - customer volume per unique active account)
    - have for VIX, want for mini-VIX and iBoxx

- must separate analysis of "new accounts" and "trading session" because most accounts trade during multiple sessions
  - new accounts per day is a fun general breakdown
  - trading size and also distinct accounts per firm filtered by trading session is useful

- currently, Asian trading session is 5pm to 2am, European is 2am to 7am, US is 7am to 5pm

x set up regular Charlie meeting

. need to not only know how many active accounts are trading, but also be able to identify those accounts and see historically what they're doing
  - track account, for instance, that used to trade in SocGen, but doesn't anymore
  - link tables - figure out extra steps to get from "# of distinct currently trading accounts" to the names of the accounts (rows in the table) to what they traded historically

. SPX options vega | ETP vega in Tableau

. keep track of 3-315, 330-4 currently gets lumped into US hours

. investigate VIX Weeklys, may need to shut down

- RJO iBoxx customer volume went to Mercury

x Charlie, Dennis, Tiago

- Litch looks at yield difference between HYG and LQD on Bloomberg
  - consider case of our iBoxx ADVs dropping 2 months in a row - Litch's charts aren't so great without context beyond volume
    - CAN'T tell people how many customers are trading, but maybe liquidity, etc.

- Barclay's goes through Fidessa, but others all go through Fidessa

. Figure out Litch's chart so Charlie can put that into Tableau

#### 2021-02-05

. work more with "modern" VIX intraday dataset - make version that's easier to do daily bespoke, instead of trying to load it all
  - function for loading one day, then script for loading it all?
  - after loading it all, collect daily trade price low high, bid low high, ask low high; do a describe on the trade prices for std dev too
    - keep in mind that they can quote 99999 asks, which would throw off close analysis of bid/ask/spread
    - process TAS ahead of time - know trade "price" on TAS is given as settle+offset (31.32), so to isolate the offset (-0.02), need to match a settle to each day and subtract

- Dennis Roll Yield meeting prep
  - first off - data source: what did you use and what should I use?
    - I had some trouble visualizing the code since I don't know the data
  - fundamentally, I've never understood - is the roll yield from the perspective of the people putting out bid-asks or the people using bid-asks?
  - need to check outrights selling and buying and also spreads buying
    - spreads should be pretty good now
  - how should TWAP work? anything to watch out for in the data (mysterious halts where quoting stays super wide for minutes, etc.)?

. (CONSULT CHARLIE) report detailing block/ECRP trades that occur on daily basis
  - ECRP how many counterparties (gonna look like 12 different ECRPs? Lakeshore exectuing for Goldman, 12 guys in crowd get in, so then it's a bunch of parties)
  - Goldman says they're not doing ECRP anymore because it's risky to enter, that's why we want to do this
  - ECRP can be VIX ETPs or VIX options for futures Jesus Christ; I made 2500 VXX shares, I delivered them this many VIX futures, etc.
    - distinguish between VIX options ECRP and VIX ETP ECRP
  - watch out for same firm reporting multiple ECRPs simultaneously (back in 2015); otherwise, pretty clear the grouping

- Top feed is BBO, Pitch feed is first in first out (matching engine); Pitch feed is what MMs use to build the book
- adding more MMs like Jump doesn't make the pie bigger - they just take Jump's volume
  - adding customers is good, since they don't care about the small fluctuations, they will do trades anyway
  - ETPs is good - generate real volume
  - these 2 types buy and actually hold

. indicative prices for VWAP

- IHS Markit prices NAV for HYG and IBXXIBHY at 2pm Central on first of month
- rebalance on last of month - ideally would settle on rebalance day, but don't know when file arrives, so it's first trade date after the rebalance!
  - hypothetically, HYG is completely synchronized with IBXXIBHY on rebalance day, slightly less synced on next trade date, but it's the best we can do
  - file in sftp/Iboxx seems to arrive 7-10am on first of month

- oh my god, yield to worst is what matters for corporate bonds
  - modern Treasury notes/bonds cannot be called early, so "to maturity" and "to worst" are the same
  - if we're lucky, to worst only requires one additional field - "callable date"
    - need to test - what if there's other convoluted situations to consider? "retirement"??
  - the ISSUER can decide to call if reissuing at lower coupon rate does them good
  - calculate yield to call and yield to maturity and yield to worst is YTC if lower, otherwise YTM
  - from Investopedia:
    "YTC is annual rate of return assuming a bond is redeemed by ISSUER at the earliest allowable callable date.
     Bond is callable if the issuer has the right to redeem it prior to the maturity date.
     YTW is the lower of the yield to call or yield to maturity.
     A put provision gives the INVESTOR the right to sell the bond back to the company at a certain price at a specified date.
     There is a yield to put, but this doesn't factor into the YTW because it is the investor's option on whether to sell the bond."

. updated sheet for Litch?

. [ONGOING] Charlie Barrett topics
  4. Accessing legacy historical data
     - what's the exact difficulty with backfilling new system with old data? why isn't it a one-time conversion for each database?
     - preference is one-time then we have it; we need a solution, direct access, so we can familiarize with what's there
  *8. how to handle alternate sources of data
    - iBoxx/HYG holdings we get via email; we don't want to lose control
    - same with S&P - shouldn't just sit around in an email inbox
    - potential new SPIKES futures Tableau dashboard - what would the data piece be like?
      - Tiago runs this, Charlie set it up
  x9. way to look at previous saved versions of a sheet?
    - I want to refresh the iBoxx daily dashboard with some obvious features (GTH, historical, etc.) and new features (term structure, historical percentiles)
    - comparison to SPX, correlation to underlying may be closely related but bespoke and separate
    A: nope. make local saves and backups.
  10. what does the "certified" data source mean for us?
  x11. what is test vs. non-test? looked at https://wiki.cboe.com/display/DP/Futures+Symbol+Reference+Data but it doesn't explain further
    A: test products; shouldn't ever have rows with VIX, etc.
  *12. working with huge databases for order size calculation?
    - is there way to run Python code directly in the cloud? - want distribution of order sizes, never-before-seen accounts
    - A: Jupyter
    - kind of breaking new ground, Paresh (Batch team) gets from trading engine to DP, but they know the technical connection questions to DP
    - order_summary (much less detail than order_fill) table is the only thing that can do it - but it's not a 1-to-1 match to order fill for some reason
  x13. [during walkthrough of iBoxx data pull?]
    - Firm Id vs. Mpid vs. Sub Id vs. ("Name" vs. On Behalf Of); is Mpid the same as On Behalf Of?? The latter has been what I consider "the actual people behind the trade", while the firm is just the member platform (Trading Technologies)
    - also, "firm Mpid" vs. Mpid in CFE Order Fill lmao
    - also, "parent firm Id"
    - how to compare when 2 columns are entirely the same (I often want to make sure I'm only deleting redundant things)?
      x see unique possible values quickly?
        A: desktop version only, right-click->"describe"
    - why some calculated fields only allow "edit copy" not edit original?
      [during walkthrough difference between the 2 CFE Dashboard OI sheets]
    - what is difference between the 2?
  x14. "Tableau" databases (maintained) vs. "the ones that appear on Hue": how to pull from the first which is the better one
  *x15. [walkthrough - build a settlement Tableau page]
    - [WIP] Issue type: "R" (iBoxx, XBT) vs. "S"
    - [WIP] "enabled", "calculation method", "price" (appears to be price on the settlement price on Bloomberg) vs. close (CFE OI + Settlement)
    - [WIP] modern: open interest off by a day from Bloomberg - BBG's 1/28 is Settlement Tableau's 1/27; so is Tableau's OI at end of trading day, and BBG sets it as beginning of trading day?
    - [WIP] historical: OI and volume are off from Bloomberg - who's right?
    x how to even set the columns?? how to adjust size of columns; A: measure values/measure names
    x how to rearrange order of filters; A: desktop only
    x dealing with dates - convert to string to avoid the default date drilldown hierarchy?
      A: exact date->set format works really well; alternatively, convert to continuous then back to discrete then set format
    *- CFE OI + Settlement, VX, Trade Date 2020-02-27, Expire Date 2020-03-25, there are 2 weeklies only different on "Calculation Method" and "Issue Type"
  16. generally, how do I visualize stuff like "15 Minute Increment"
  x17. how to get and deal with firm trades on block and ECRP (especially types of ECRP - VIX options vs. VIX ETP)
    - follow-up to see it in Tableau
  18. have you guys done anything with VIX futures/options vega volumes or VIX ETP associated vega volumes?
  20. OI by firm?
  *21. be go-between on Charlie's dashboard - explain to Michael on next call
    - example: remember heatmap of last 13 quarters? standout is Barclays - they're in 60th percentile while others are in 20th. what's driving this for Barclays?
  22. pivot tables in Excel vs. Tableau
  23. how realistic is it to thoroughly clean up CFE Settlement + OI and CFE Order Fill? how big of a project for you?
      - goal is for Michael to be able to click "edit" and know what fields to swap around

#### 2021-02-09

o iBoxx Sales
  - Markit changed settlement prices from 2pm to 3pm!! now aligned with HYG, everything.
  . break down OI by firm?

. export VIX futures Bloomberg stuff and give to Charlie
. Albert Jimenez could probably answer Issue Type

o Bob Siverson Options on Futures
  - modifying/updating futures - take out and put in separate doc?
  - who's going to be using options on futures? A: liquidity providers going to be people already trading on CBOE (do things as CBOE does)
  - what is the "underlying" lmao?
  . question from me: why does CME do Treasury options expiry 20 days before futures maturity? should we watch out for the same?
  . question from me: price-time vs. pro-rata matching algorithm?
  . question from me: block spread vs. block strip?

#### 2021-02-10

o iBoxx Catch-Up
  - Credit Suisse: after giving demo to asset manager, waiting to see if they'll trade
  - JP Morgan: CTA interested, also someone assumed to be Crable; should set up call
  - Jump, Jane, Crabel holy trinity for Union to add $200MM more, etc. to come in
  - Germany is still restricted jurisdiction from FX (has been for a year?); we can't go promote iBoxx there
    - Margolis said Brexit? That's rubbish, since exchange is based in USA
      - trying to get separate Germany approval, waiting for some body in Germany for a year
  - Clear says CME is actively exploring corporate bond index futures
  - TD, etc. are actively resistant against Mini VIX; everyone agrees a salesperson specifically for retail products makes no sense

o Minis Webinar
  - chart with premium on call and put spreads?
  - difference in dividend betting though: European mini options XSP vs. American ETF options SPY
    - ex-date, could exercise SPY to claim the dividend
    - can do put/call parity to see early exercise effects
  - OptionVue
  - structured product potential

. CFE OI + Settlement table: I guess it makes sense to not have spreads, but how is spread volume treated?

- my god, finally made the "historical daily lookup"/"unified data table"/"settlement data pull" thing in Tableau
  . add a daily volume aggregation
  . ask how to adjust the columns?
  . use the chart to fill Doug Luzzi on iBoxx
    . Dave Seng instead
  . investigate term structure
  . SPX context - filter based on big SPX drop days, etc.
    - don't forget context of 1) customers, 2) ETPs
  *. YOOO TAS DOESN'T WORK - it's not even in this for some reason?
  *. iBoxx 11/1/2019 doesn't have volume lmao what, 7/3/2019 missing, 11/29/2019 missing, etc.

. enforce column order in pull_futures_prices(); also add way to not only do PX_LAST

- firm ID is port owner, TTCH - physical connections to CFE, for billing (type of MPID/TPH)
- sub Id is the port number, market data uses it
- clearing firm (efid)
  - Jump has 6 efids, basically 6 offices, different business line/strategy
- Mpid vs. Efid, one to many
- clearing accounts not used for billing (optional field)
- exec ID is in common on both sides, order ID is distinct
- on behalf of is Mpid, MLCO executing firm
. display size and price?
- CFE Accounts and OI is the one for open and close info, DON'T use CFE Order Fill lol
  - Settlement + OI really only used for OI
- CMTA is the give-up
. account is the end user, the individual at the exec?
- FIX protocol? - way to enter orders on the exchange (all our exchanges use it)
  - account comes from there, can track back
  - operator ID as well
- order ID is common between legs of spread trade
- clearing_opt is clearing optional data
- frequent trader not in futures anymore, still a thing in options
- market marks the start of Symbol ID table joined in
- complex from Symbol ID is misleading; joined in on Symbol Id field, all Symbol IDs are NOT complex; elsewhere in Order Summary, there are complex Symbol IDs
- begin and end when listed
- Clearing Firm Id marks next table joined in; exclusively used for "Name" field
- Name is name for "On Behalf Of"
- complex field comes from flags

#### 2021-02-16

- VXM to-do: stratify customers by how long since they started trading
  - account could be in common with VIX

. Evaluate Charlie spreadsheet with Michael
  - by product, by firm, by account
  - good for drilldown, can click to exclusively display account
    x the click exclusivity doesn't extend to the trade detail panel; EDIT: it does, maybe I had an error
  - can search for account
  - very slow doing certain things, but if we set up a default view, we don't have to do 4 or 5 applies each time
    - the applies are mandatory for each category
  . can we have an enable/disable switch for the trade detail panel for speed?
  . not filtering product in firm level
  . hide columns?
  . contras details, original order details (order size, how long it took to execute?); pre-open? what about if Jump has a ton of orders within a second?
  . is Tableau the right tool for this?
  . "is that the biggest trade? what's the context"
  . GTH? use pivot tables as a reference

. Litch iBoxx update - do monthly instead of weekly?
  . figure out narrative with Michael - his top 5 things that happened in past month
    - e.g. know that Hemal got Union in, so correspondingly spend 10 seconds highlighting Union volumes

. UVXY dashboard
  - Laura Morrison short interest
  - insight into TVIX shorting type activity

. Dimitrios HYG adjusted total return?
  - I thought he was clear on the formula

. Litch stuff in email
  - roll yield should fall out of this
  - also cross-correlations against SPX, etc. - expect very little correlation between iBoxx and other assets managers may be trading (FX, Treasuries, SPX)
  - do this at start of March

. my dashboard - link CFE Order Fill and add TAS and volume
  - Charlie said open and close info should come from Accounts and OI?

- parent clearing firm?
. Python in DP - ask Parth
- block_trade in cfe_ref_data has Block/ECRP
- Charlie will work on some fields

#### 2021-02-22

- note to self: shortcut to from iBoxx notional to # contracts is multiply by 7: $100MM notional is 700 contracts

x read Sarah Cummings, direct Danny to Sarah after you've read her emails!
x respond to Litch email(s) and ask about call!

. Scott Elias at EDF Man is poster child for iBoxx data needs - futures roll, index vs. future

. Tableau tooltip column names? (days to expiry DTE)

x forward Doug Luzzi stuff to Dave Seng

. Annapurna questions: 1) all RTH have common problem? 2) could anything be wrong with bid and ask sizes?
. Charlie dashboard

. to refine my Tableau stuff, Michael has 2 sets of comments - 1 in email, 1 in Teams (about Settlement page)

. respond to Tiago in Teams about the iBoxx spreads dashboard idea

. 10:45 in Annapurna is a separate problem for holidays lol
  *. even further - dig into her dashboard code; why 15 minutes? can we configure that to maybe 5?

- we're talking to Tru Mid about listing blocks on their trading platform

. Michael spread stuff
. Michael VXM common accounts stuff

- between 2021-02-17 and 2021-02-18, iShares website holdings/XLS files added a disclaimer built into the sheets, so code is kind of broken
- apparently Python doesn't by default open() in utf-8, so have to explicitly specify encoding for XLS now. The " used in disclaimer writes as \xe2\x80\x9c which breaks the default encoding
- from 2020-08-25 to 2020-09-14, there were no cashflows files for some reason
- once and for all, Bloomberg's current shares outstanding is number for end of each day; BlackRock's is generally at end of previous day (for use on "as of" date)
  - however, BlackRock's files are somewhat inconsistent among themselves with usage of "trade date" vs. "as of date":
    1) Daily Values (received 7pm 2020-11-03), labeled "trade date 2020-11-04"
       - the gold standard for 11/3 EOD; matches Bloomberg 11/3 in shares outstanding, total assets, and NAV (triangle good for calcs! can get any from other 2)
    2) Holdings (recieved 7am 2020-11-04), labeled "fund holdings as of 2020-11-03"
       - contains holdings at end of 11/3, but shares outstanding at beginning of 11/3 i.e. end of 11/2;
         even more confusingly, the sum of "Market Value" column is IBOR (immediate update), whereas everything else is ABOR (update at close), so will be off slightly!
       - extremely confusingly, this means that compared to Bloomberg/Daily Values, shares outstanding is off by a day by convention, total assets is off slightly by convention, and there's no way to derive NAV!
         0 for 3, only useful for holdings info, for which it unfortunately gets a lot of use!
    3) Proof (PCF) (received 7am 2020-11-04), labeled "2020-11-03" (inside file, this matches "trade date")
       - contains shares outstanding at beginning of 11/3 i.e. end of 11/2
       - divide shares by 100,000 shares/unit to get units
       - here's the kicker: NAV matches the one we thought was end of 11/3, but the shares outstanding and total assets that form its triange are DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN DAILY VALUES
         - surely this means the order of operations at 3pm-7pm day T is:
           1. the number of shares is as it was 7pm T-1
           2. use T prices with T-1 basket composition to get "intermediate" net assets
           3. divide "intermediate" net assets by T-1 shares to get T NAV
           4. do creation/redemption, increasing or decreasing net assets and number of shares, to obtain T net assets and T shares outstanding
           T NAV, T net assets, T shares outstanding appear in Daily Values
           T holdings list with IBOR prices instead of ABOR i.e. pseudo-T net assets, T-1 shares outstanding appear in Holdings
           T NAV, "intermediate" net assets, T-1 shares outstanding appear in Proof
  - BlackRock seems to be doing to Bloomberg on shares outstanding the thing Bloomberg does to us with open interest - passing it forward a day for use

o How Michael looks at volumes
  - MY SHEET
  - first thing is "wait volumes started really fast early in the day"
  - what's the distribution of volumes in maturities compared to previous days
  . need to see percentage breakdown of maturities (vs. normally what it is)
    - idea: action filter and switch tabs for the graph to see filtered first term (with percentage showing)
  - this leads into "wonder what the term structure change was from one day to the next"
  . want to not only see the term structure curves look different, but also the difference (subtraction) between the 2
  - next, open interest - 13k drop in front month, but only 6k increase to second, so it's not just roll, people are taking OI off
  . need change in open interest
  - ECRP volume looks surprisingly big - normal way they execute is they do delta neutral tied to futures, but usually as spread (buy near strike, sell further away)
    - if 3000 VIX futures are coming through ECRP, maybe that indicates huge options activity
    - the other explanation is VIX ETPs: delivered to ProShares in correct weighting for ETP shares
  . need to link ECRP color, especially splitting options from ETP creation/redemption
  - TAS is tied to ETP activity - big ETP volumes may be linked to big TAS - if there residual TAS, or the opposite, did ProShares etc. trade through the book preemptively?
  . NEED TAS
  - Charlie's Sheet
  - well first off, why is overall volume in "size". we don't want to divide by 2
  - Wolverine basically only trades TAS
  - high touch vs. electronic, we have NO ONE at Barclays with high touch to just call and ask about
    - FCM report is excuse to call people and figure out what's going on
  . BARCLAYS CTI 2 doesn't even show up; do they go through Fidessa or something?
  . make trade dates descending, not ascending
  - AHA SocGen account traded 14k, that's almost certainly the missing ProShares TAS volume! wow
  . CTI 4 percent - today was 19%, had to calculate it, which is annoying
  . as usual, is it more guys, or is it same guys more volume?
  . make expiration date filter only "show relevant"
  - workflow requires remembering to filter out spreads (or selecting expiry)
  . seeing the buy/sell ratio would be nice (tooltip?)
  - observation: selling in Asian hours, buying in US hours is a plausible strategy
  . buy/sell ratio by GTH would be interesting
  - Bloomberg TSM (trade summary matrix) and RITA (realtime intraday trade analysis)
  . ideally want to see what time the biggest executed trade of the day happened
  - Bloomberg: VIX CT (contract table), filter weeklies; then you get term structure (CCRV commodity curve analysis), etc.
  - most people create ETF shares to short - like UVXY
    - so ETF assets go up when ironically people put money in to take shares out to short
  - we haven't even talked about VVIX

#### 2021-02-25

- SMARTS futures maturity code location: CFE Market Statistics page->Navigation tab on left->Product Info->Simple and Complex product CSVs

. oh god damn it. I never wrote the code for getting live dividends from the emails
  . speaking of emails, you should have the code email you if it fails lol
. review your argument about BlackRock/Bloomberg ACF using the wrong cashflows
. need to revise a lot of things in bonds_analytics to work with corporate bonds, which are still usually semiannual but can mature on any day of month, not just 15 or last day
  . create_coupon_schedule()
  x get_coupon_status()
- Ford CUSIP 345370CW8 is a good example of weird corporate bond - maturity on 22nd of month, and last coupon in BBG CSHF is on 2025-03-22 instead of maturity 2025-04-22??
  - even weirder, Allison Transmission 019736AG2 has coupon maturity cycle on 1/30 and 7/30 - note that it's not end-of-month! this breaks pd.date_range() semimonthend day-of-month
    - even weirder, Prime Secsrvc 74166MAF3 has only 1 call date, 1 year before maturity, AND its coupon cycle (6/15, 12/15) does not play according to maturity (8/31)
      - unlike Treasury bonds, MUST know first coupon date for corp bonds, and MUST know call dates
      - by the way, if it's not squarely 6 months, the fractions are done in 30/360, e.g. 2027-06-15 to 2027-08-31 is 2 months 16 days i.e. 76 days out of 180, coupon is 76/180 * S/A coupon
    - even weirder, 28414HAG8 has maturity on 8/28, coupon cycle being 8/28 and 2/28. they don't even care about end-of-month vs. not, so code would def break
- generally, corp bonds seem to be callable on maturity date once per year, but there was one with only once call date on next to last year

- note to self, when you rename files in PyCharm and let them refactor, they change the scratch files, which is a huge unintended annoyance
- note to self, for gaibo_modules, good to separate optional Bloomberg functionality into separate functions so they can be taken off for no_pdblp versions

o Charlie
  *- FactSet data - could mean we have internal data, beyond original compliance use
  - 13F - hedge funds holdings, quarterly basis, SEC, delayed but official numbers
    - getting from Hanweck
  - COT
  - Hanweck seems to cherrypick from FT Options
  - OPRA stuff on DP from LiveVol? is that right?
  - Ankit is the guy for LiveVol data - could probably give directory of data
  - Jerry Hanweck might be the guy for Hanweck
  - CME data (purchased by Hanweck) will be available through DP too!
  - join futures_us.order_summary with cfe_ref_data.v_symbol

#### 2021-02-26

*. VIXTLT basis point MUST DOs:
  1. get Tiago to push the time back even more
  2. write email-scraping code (alternatively, scrape website sidebar!?) and get Tiago to automate it
  3. ask Tiago how to look at these numbers again lol
    - previously it was Jenkins and the internal index tool
    . look at your hourly code lmao what does it even do?
  4. why are we doing it hourly? what's the limitation

. ask Michael - there's no real progress in time for Tuesday VXM and iBoxx calls - what do I do

- approach Sarah with - hey we're going to launch this in a month and a half, can you get us absolutely everything? we're working with Parag Shah, Matt Brenan
. implied cash date vs. settle date lmaooo - one question is why in BlackRock's ACF calculation (reflected in cashflows files), coupon is arriving on implied cash date rather than the settle date on those specific cases
. IBOR vs. ABOR 3pm to 4pm recently
. cash component (implied cash generally) figure out with Sarah
. how the hell do market makers get this information? surely they care about ACF modified durations, etc. promise a delivery time of Xpm?

#### 2021-03-01

- Union's roll through Goldman - fun thing is that Virtu had to take on and price it as a risk trade because it was so near expiry

. Annapurna's Market Quality code review
  - 
. Annapurna's CFE Order Summary report
  - 
  . how do we make it faster? have it default only show the latest day on open?

- my hourly code code review
  - my bloomberg_data_snapshots_v2.py + generate_current_CTD_MD.py is actually exclusively for CME Treasury VIX
  - my scrape_ishares_csv.py + create_cashflows_dice.py are for VIXTLT
  - convert_osaka_format.py is exclusively for CME Treasury VIX, even though I experimentally put VIXTLT bonds into it
    - basis point VIXTLT does not even need bond prices - MD is calculated on the super-bond, i.e. just the ETF's price is used
  - I started a file for documenting this stuff - P:\ProductDevelopment\Products\ETF Tsy VIX\Basis Point VIXTLT Process Memo.docx

x reply Tiago and inform him of the document (also let Michael know)

- I made a horrible mistake in one of the VXM pivot tables: in the data, I started with descending dates, but then started appending ascending at the end, so months had 2x volume lmao. fixed.
  x need histogram for distribution of daily/monthly size for EACH customer; that's the only proper way to answer what customers are like - it's very important to not generalize

- what is an introducing broker - client-facing subsidiary of FCM
- closing only - can only close your existing position (for delisted products)
- threshold width - how wide bid-ask can be to allow the series to open

x send meeting to Michael for Thursday afternoon

- I don't understand it, but if you go Data->Data Tools->Green Icon Go to Power Pivot->Diagram View, you can edit "model table name"
  that shows up in PivotTable Fields

x look at "existing customers" average daily size per account, i.e. returning interested customers

- Tableau sheets
  - note to self: CFE website counts Weeklys in VIX+TAS
  x add tooltip with 1) abbreviations, 2) explanation of volume including or not including TAS
  . known problem: CFE Order Fill's complex=' ' shows block+ECRP accurately, but CFE OI+Settlement's Block Volume does not!
    example: 2021-02-26, there was 4900 in block according to CFE website, but OI+Settlement shows 0
  . complex size (according to Charlie doesn't include block/ECRP) vs. size lmao
  . watch video on viz with percent
  . create term structure viz
    . Charlie tutorial on
      1) markers (coloring with weekly vs. monthly)
      2) difference from previous day and difference from contango
      3) adding VIX index (which table to join?)
      4) have the sheet start with most recent 5 days selected - I know the checkmark for single most recent day
  . add in CTI, trading session (define curb yourself lol)
  . somehow do percentiles with a configurable lookback

. are there TAS spreads? yes. what about block TAS. yes. ECRP (EXPH?) TAS. yes. how do they work and get tucked into volume? block spread? no.
. send Citadel stuff to data analytics

- redefine volume as sum of all 4
. OHLC doesn't need to be here
. remove tooltip text to elsewhere
. tooltip stuff (spread volume, think about showing specific sell one buy other when hovering) in term structure chart is absolutely necessary
. drill out in Volumes Deep Dive, starting from most recent date

*o iBoxx new deck project
  - Litch has evolved his deck to be very talk-oriented - he'll chat away the details
  - we need to solidify those details into a readable set of slides, for those who don't want to talk to Litch ("send me what you got")
  - should include evolution of the product - roll yield, how much of index gets thrown out each month, correlation index/futures or to CDX
  - use Litch and Frantz Castor as resources, make a deck to share
  . well, what are we sending right now?
  - Hemal and co. have the laundry list Jira ticket for Eileen - use that as inspiration
  - apparently Options Institute wants to do inter-department charging, so that's why it's all on me
  *. Monday meeting to go over outline - I should compile:
    - what we send now, Litch emails miscellania (correlation, roll yield), Hemal Jira list
    - liquidity? comparison to comparable products?
    - I should also look back at Yoshiki material - he has a good thought process for "telling a story"
  - we can eventually get to the point of having tutorials in there for subscribing to us on Bloomberg
  - want whole thing done in 2-3 weeks. yike
  *. first prep an outline
    . then try to sprint the first draft out, then work slowly

o VIXTLT Meeting
  - DICE is an intraday dissemination engine, has its own language, has intraday dataset available inside it
  - Dennis would call it Dave's (Wegner) Intraday Calculation Engine; real name "Dynamic"?
  *. my action item: ask Sarah Cummings for production method for holdings/cashflows
    - ask her to hop on a call with Michael, add Dimitrios and Danny and see if they have questions
    - ahead of Thursday 10am
  - Michael Izhaky emphasizes that we should not be the ones scrambling to fix index at 7am - there has to be protocol; currently it's us
  - Tiago's Credit VIX process to production:
    he wrote the code, had everything done, handed it to IPE about 2 years ago with a PID, now it's all automated
  - Index group is in ISG, they signal that if it's not revenue-generating, they won't do it; is it their job or no?
    A: they won't put the research into it, so we do that and hand it to them

o Bob Siverson
  . LMM rebate validation: time quoting within benchmark, volumes, validate rebate
    - might be good for Tableau
    - Thomas's team does this, but Bob needs a double-check
    - break apart volume portion and quoting portion
    . LMM legal filing contains the thresholds, Michael will send
  . block/ECRP - want number of contras, so need to link block_trade; going to have to link by time, maybe not order ID?
  - TARP is some kind of TAS database, going to use for June

o Charlie
  - Bob Siverson - block/ECRP table in Tableau?
    - Charlie putting into CFE Order Fill within a week, I'll make dashboard
  - Jenn Fortino Citadel request - how do I get data analytics to do this?
    - Jira for big, send to Charlie for small
  - complex size - why on Earth are they not even numbers
  - term structure
  - Annapurna top of book
  - A: question mark with other sheet tooltip into dashboard
  - A: "Historical Index Values" - Tableau table with VIX, may need to use latest_trading_date, create VIX Index

x send Michael software for Tim Thies to install on new PCs
  - Tableau Desktop
  - Anaconda
  - PyCharm IDE
  - mysql-connector-odbc-8.0.18-winx64.msi - something for running database functions from Anshul's code
  - Bloomberg Anywhere
  - Git (I don't remember how I installed this)
  - Following probably available through Software Center, but just in case:
    - WinSCP
    - Google Chrome
    - Horizon (to access SMARTS)
. move off of Y drive by March 21

- ICE has NYSE, bought and turned Enron's trading segment and turned them into an oil platform competing with CME's WTI
  - CME didn't want to buy Cboe because they want nothing to do with the SEC

- Litch and Dennis doing roll yield/cost differently
  - Dennis is for each day, in basis points
  - Litch is for running sum, in $
  - what is the actual number that people want to hear? as a response to "what is the roll cost?", should we say
    "from this date to this date, assuming roll occurs 3 days before maturity, it was xxx dollars per future (or basis points... but what to divide by)?"
    - Dennis's covers a bit more I think - gives you insight into when it is best to roll

. Dimitrios thread
  x ask Michael: what's the plan going forward - is Frantz Castor going to send us borrow data?
    - Frantz not planning to send more right now - there's a different guy Frantz is talking to. we know what we want, so we'll certainly ask
    . pay attention to the Markit calls and keep Dimitrios updated
  x send him updated HYGTR using TOT_RETURN_INDEX_GROSS_DVDS (Dennis made that spreadsheet)
  . finish Dimitrios LQD download

. for Charlie
  . example on the spread trades legging in or no
    . how did you do an "or" filter so cleanly there on order_id for the 2 legs and exec_id for the contras?
  - EFID is not clearing firm lol
  . Citadel CDRG clears through Barclays BCAP - none of "on behalf of", "firm ID" (MPID), "clearing firm" (EFID) show this information
    - in order router report, MPID=BCAP gets us "on behalf of"
    - Barclays has some old trading system called Barcs, and then bought from Goldman something called Ready
      - Fidessa seems like Trading Technologies - Barclays has given customers access to platform called Fidessa, which goes through Barclays somehow
  . go over block_trade
    - what does "state" mean? td-submitted and submitted seem to be the only ones with exec_id that is not NULL...
      - it seems that "expired" will actually cancel one of the other orders. great...
      - might need to go with "entry_ts" instead of "trade_ts"?
    - how do you know what product it's for - it doesn't say VX
  *. ask about best way to put percentile of historical into dashboards, as well as percent of total volume; historical percentile of percent of volume lol

. Annapurna-Charlie megacall to hash out Order Router report workflow
  - the golden standard: Kathy Drew's CSV
  - the dashboards in question: CFE Activity Dashboard and Futures Order Routers Report
  - the fields in question and their origins: 

x email Franz about borrow rates
*. [ONGOING] prompt Sarah/Krista for ETA on FTP (split the communications - Sarah FTP sample, Krista technical)
  . ask for sample TLT file so we can start prepping for production
  . bring up cash flows calculation (last mentioned to Ojas)
  . bring up questions on the https://wiki.cboe.com/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=117056294&draftShareId=1a85b9d8-1be9-4bda-a6dc-f226b6d1bfe8&

. block_trade project for Bob
  - Lakeshore messed an ECRP price up (33 instead of 31 or something), no one realized it was off until end of day; this is why OCC is asking about ECRP
  - ABN AMRO clears for Lakeshore by the way
  - OCC wants us to put safeguards on this - seems like not our job but okay
  - ECRP reporting time is 30 minutes apparently
  - OCC doesn't know what's happening in TAS until EOD - people can amass huge positions and they can't regulate

o Basis Point VIXTLT meeting with Brian Eck
  - don't forget, VIXTLT price percent is already in production! we are just adding the basis point version
  - the code for BP VIXTLT is very simple; main obstacle is receiving file from FTP, converting to proper format, putting into DICE to combine and output
  - Izhaky: DStrat (Prod Dev/Research) will no longer be the operators for this stuff - need to be able to pass it off from the lab
  - Brian Eck mentions "OC monitoring" I think?
  - remember that our daily files for TYVIX is still making Brian's group do stuff
  - Kevin Yaussy is probably the last person who knows how to maintain DICE (maybe also Victor)
  - ask for sample file from FTP! so we can get started
  - need to go through Batch to receive the FTP stuff - remember to work with them
  . prep the "frozen" code to send to Brian Eck's team; obviously there is variable of what the FTP file will look like
  . once we finish VIXTLT reliance on FTP, I must cut the holdings CSV dependency out of my BP TYVIX code to stop idx_get_file_ustf failures

. Litch bespoke data request VIX RTH

x email Dave Stange about not being on the list

. Michael: there's a short interest report that we put out, can see UVXY??
  - Laura Morrison

- I think I understand why borrow rates are negative now - it means people are overwhelmingly lending their ETFs to borrow spending cash,
                                                           as opposed to desperately trying to borrow ETFs to short
  - consider repo agreement where bondholder gives bond to bank to get money, with repurchase agreement to buy the bond back at higher price
    - that's how repo is used to lend money. the lender of the bond actually loses money to borrow cash.
  - borrow rates being negative mean a ton of people are lending their ETFs for cash to spend, with agreement to return more money.

- words of wisdom from Yoshiki:
  As a general rule, it's seldom a good idea to run regressions on levels given their persistence.
  So, let's run everything in terms of changes, which could be an absolute change or a relative change (e.g. return).
  You should think through which is more appropriate for each variable from an economic interpretation perspective.

- what I have in mind for Tableau "historical percentiles"
  - good way to swap between aggregations
  - percent of total volume (done manually with division calculated fields)
  - percentiles are in table calculations - can we get them to be configurable to certain lengths of history?
    - viz for percentiles

o Charlie
  - Tim Thedinger can help with block_trade data, otherwise short term solution is join to CFE Order Fill (I guess on exec_id, since that's the only common field)
  - if statement solves the contra being variably simple or complex
  - MPID in CSV appears to be "parent clearing firm" - has nothing to do with trade but rather with Citadel's clearing arrangement
  - "date level"
  - data analytics - market share overview dashboard is a goldmine
  - Data Analytics->General->Market Share (keep in mind, higher level organizing for reference for random people)

x check Litch's requirements; edit dashboard "other" to show the adjustable Time Frame
. patch Annapurna's sheet too for downloading purposes
  . create combined volume and liquidity timeframe download dashboard; include (Asian/European) GTH vs. US (RTH) switch in addition to timeframes

- Annapurna is finally working on the Market Quality dashboard re-work
- Charlie is on joining block_trades into CFE Order Fill

x answer/be familar with VIXTLT Jira questions

. prepare for SWATS
  - VXM
    - preface, want to first cover the "new content" from two weeks ago, because I didn't speak then
      - added some more columns to the spreadsheets - ADV, avg size per unique active account
      - big one: "new accounts vs. existing": fresh accounts vs. guys who keep coming back; show active customers column of existing, highlight people coming back to their accounts in Jan
        - we're on track now; % of total volume tells us that each month, 30-40% of the volume we see are from guys just trying out the product; this is subtle - we want to see
          returning customers claiming a large portion of the volume, but also in this growth phase we want numerically a lot of young accounts trading and putting up big numbers in volume
          - 1/6 customers active at any given time for this regular brigade
      - average accounts trading per day (continued up 30 last time), around 212, not bad, but continuing the steady uptrend, so slower than it has been
      - average size per account trading per day stayed the same as last month, 6.8 to 6.7, lower than Jan's high 8.1
      - 222 new accounts in March coming from usual suspects - IB, ABN, tasty (in Feb, ABN and tasty did big numbers); growth seems low compared to the robust numbers we've been getting
      - summary of the volume: new accounts is way below what we're used to, existing guys are holding strong, overall below
      - summary of the OI: note regular big drops in OI - people don't roll. anyway, OI is 9k, ADV is like 15k (CTI 4 ADV is around 1k)
      - histogram - retail was always going to be focused on tiny volume in hopefully a lot of people, but as it stands would need tens of thousands of people trading every day. long way to go
    . Danny Jisa's point - are people closing out their contracts? how do we even know that - is it possible to do open interest per account?
    . what about the concept of a "revived" account - track last trade date in addition to join date?
    . "retention rate" for IB vs. ABN vs. tasty
    . back month quote quality
  - IBHY
    - first want to clarify that CTI 4 volumes in January we boosted because of prop group using wrong CTI; so I said customer volume dropped Jan to Feb, and Litch had it right as an increase
    - ADV 24 vs. 77 and 111 (Jan is boosted) - not necessarily terrible because 3/4 of the monthly volume comes from the second half roll (order of hundreds vs. 10) which starts around the 20th, but fairly low compared to past months
    - % of total volume (against CTI 2) - 2% vs. 6.6%, 8.1% but again, the ADV is so low so far (but again, it's 22 vs if you take the first half of previous months like 30-40)
    - OI has stayed at right around 1000, ADV all CTIs is sitting at 926
    - list out new accounts:
        RJO had a new account, and on 3/1 an old account active that hasn't traded since 11/2019;
        IB had 2 new accounts;
        Goldman's 1 account doing 190 on 1 day accounts for half the volume so far this month;
        SG has 2 accounts trading more regularly accounting for 12%;
        EDF's single trade of 75 is currently 17%;
        ADM Investor Services is brand new on the list, with first customer trading 14 size on 3/2
    - let's go over last month too since that was slightly more interesting
      - 9 new accounts 4 were IB, 3 from Credit Suisse but all 1 person, 1 JPM, 1 EDF
      - Union's roll accounted for 50% of volume, next was SocGen's 3 accounts for 18%, JPM's 3 for 10%, IB's 20 for 10%, UBS's 2 for 7%, Credit Suisse's dabble was 2%
    - young vs. old accounts: nothing we can conclude so far; historically 20-25 active old accounts doing 90%+ volume (since November); on average old accounts doing something like 117
      - retention rate: 1/5 of total accounts who have traded show up at any given time
    - histogram: they're not necessarily the average or median customer type, but there is a portion of customers (10%) who regularly come in aiming to do on the level of $10MM

. for Charlie
  . first let's check in on topics from Teams chat this week: Block Trade project
  . CFE Activity Dashboard ideas:
    1) add in new parent clearing the way we like it
    2) 3rd sheet with action filter to zoom in when specific orders are selected and give firm's order history for day (not filled, just all of them)
    3) maybe block sheet?
  . orders (not filled) which DP table is that again? order_summary, Annapurna actually put it into Tableau
    - they go through CFE Order Fill with a fine-toothed comb, but anything else is basically no so good
  . OI by firm?
  . Tableau pull in holidays list? useful for making sure 10:30am on a holiday counts as GTH, not RTH
    - not in DP, but it's in production, could potentially put it into DP if it's useful, but probably no need since Annapurna got around it
  . show context when we encounter * when using ATTR() - example IBHY settle price change on 3/1
    - Issue Type S is standard settlement method, R is restate; if R exists, show R, otherwise show S, but also it would be cool to see both...
      - wait, how would we even do that?
  - idea: literally split settle price from the volumes so we can easily add exclusive tooltip; split OHLC so we can do percentiles, etc.
  - "on behalf of": specific to the trade
    - "firm ID" is who it comes through; both are MPIDs
  - executing is EFID - there are a bunch of them
  - occ_id (related to parent clearing) is also needed for unique relationship to a specific trade!
    - join is fcm firm_mpid onto "on behalf of" of the trade, second piece joining to occ_id on trade as well
      - BUT WAIT, occ_is not natively on the trade; trade has EFID, join from firm_clearing_method and get occ_id, then you can use occ_id (don't ask me, Charlie says you HAVE to do this)
  - firm_mpid and mpid_name are together
  - second firm_mpid and parent_clearing are together; they are the parent clearing
  - end_dt is the end date of contract tying EFID to parent clearing firm - CNRD Concorde changed from Terra Nova to EDF for example
  - confusingly, parent clearing firm code EDFC is tied to both EDF Man and Terra Nova, separated only by contract end_dt; unclear, could be some backfilling correction going on
    - also, seems like there was gaps between end_dt and next begin_dt
  - "middle layer" of Python in the works so Tableau's not crunching order summary data from DP in the front end

. take out OHLC and replace with percentage and percentiles
  . actually, if we leave OHLC in and add historical percentiles as uniform tooltip (plus range chart graphic), that could be pretty sick.
    - percentage of total volume just can't squeeze in...
  - btw, OHLC is literally the last bid OR offer associated with the product, according to Albert Jiminez (not trade, not even midpoint)

. for Michael
  - Sarah
  - Danny's question on closing positions - never thought about that before. that would require OI on a customer level right? have we ever had stats on that?
  - dashboard updates - daily historical lookup patched to stability

. goals due Friday - Markets group takes it much more seriously than MAS; be VERY specific, whereas in MAS it was general
. school-year intern - Arianne says fine, we could tap Phillip or Ben
  - my own brainstorm - maybe have them talk to Parth, figure out his material
- omnibus account - common account for a bunch of guys at the FCM, they themselves know how to separate, we don't
  - this screws up using buy and sell to track individual account OI
  - idea: start at beginning of a maturity being listed
  - scenario: buy through Goldman, sell through JPM; you are flat, but others don't know (and that's the point, make your book opaque, though you're paying margin twice)
  - mini-VIX OI weird because it goes out through big VIX
. ask in Eileen's forum about Python queries/workflows with DP/Tableau (currently I've heard from Charlie that it's "in the works, but long-term")
. Michael just sent something Sarj got about iBoxx roll - quick read
x Michael's advice - try blocking off Outlook schedule to specifically study stuff

o Pallavi iBoxx Roll
  . walk me through the data (you mentioned it will be in Data Platform, which parts exactly?)
  . how exactly do you do the roll yield?
  - Tiago working with data team to get bespoke deriv strat data
  . send R script to Pallavi
  . Data: Markit FTP daily files, S&P website for equity select sector returns, Cboe website daily statistics put in a date and get IBHY, Bloomberg for CDX and HYG, Bloomberg for HY Energy, OAS from FTP files
  . consider putting roll yield stuff into gaibo_modules
  - takeaway: Pallavi will 1) streamline her data sources code to run an update every Monday, 2) touch up some of the sheets, 3) big touch up of the roll costs how we want it (conditional on me showing them exactly what we want)
    - my plan: 
  - it's all good for comparing to HYG, CDX even doable with Bloomberg, but what about TRS (Markit's MarkitServe has people use their indexes to write TRS, and then tracks those)
    - theoretically Frans could tell us what the average price of TRS executed was for a given month, but there's a Chinese wall between MarkitServe and their part of the business
    - we could come up with hypothetical TRS using HYG rate and other rate ourselves though, rolling quarterly IMM dates or something March 20 to June 20, etc.

. study top-of-book data source (think about re-making Annapurna's stuff, putting together the roll example for Tiago and Pallavi)
  - select * from block_trade where block_trade.trade_ts >= '2020-01-01' remember that's the date format that works on Hue
  - liquidity_provider table shows a lot of promise for individual firm stats... 1) does Annapurna use it, 2) does billing use it?
  - oh my god Weeklys are what truly throw off avg spread widths; the other relevant filters (session, complex, near_term_ind) all make a small difference too
  . currently on 4th sheet of CFE Market Quality and CTI Sizes
  . make a back-month liquidity report
  . time interval vs. time interval new?
  . need to confirm whether time interval of 8:30am means 8:15am-8:30am summary or 8:30am-8:45am summary (I think it's the first)
  . min(update_time) and max(next_time)?
  . TAS vs. Standard - no sub product types?
    - VXT? does that work
  . how does 2 Hour Groups work??
  . how do time-weighted spreads work for complex when I split them by expire_date?
  . Time Interval (Hours) does not open??
  . Time Calc group is definitely broken - different number of 12s (9) from 10s (8) from 14s (7)

- European close 4:30pm British time?
- when volumes are stressed, people don't want delta, they want optionality
  - compare iBoxx options potential to HYG options activity this year

- the way I'm prioritizing things right now: 1) figuring out top-of-book data - it's relevant both to me making dashboards and iBoxx content; 2) adding percentile visuals to Volumes Deep Dive, bespoke iBoxx Python
  - also need to work on Charlie parent clearing firm - match with order routers, then swap into CFE Activity Dashboard
  - work on Krista files check-out

. send Michael details on Charlie/Annapurna parent clearing firm discussion once I figure it out

. Krista big response

- Litch: Standard Life is one of the most sophisticated investment companies in using ETFs

- Michael: we don't even give Bloomberg OI until 2 days later; we need to verify Bloomberg's not 2 days late, but rather they backfill 1 day

x send Bob message heads-up Charlie

*o Michael - CFE Activity Dashboard (SEND TO CHARLIE)
  . descending order for trading days/months on sidebar - super simple
  . side-by-side is needed for dates
    - need per month grand total
  - it would actually be useful to see how much is complex-complex vs. complex-simple
  . "on a daily basis, I don't want to have to do this. the common questions should be summarized easily each month. remember, that's a thing we want"
o Michael - my dashboard
  - date's are super unwieldy - Charlie's method is really good realistically
  - summary page for different types of volume is really good let's get that out
    - separate settlement page from volumes

. https://wiki.cboe.com/display/GCS/iBOXX+-+Slides
  . send to Matt the study from 2 years ago
  - do this within a week - meet with John Angelos
  - Bloomberg as a bulk data source in the first draft makes sense
  - ping in Teams as we go through
  - tail risk - are we doing distribution
  - Zephyr - Matt Moran std dev tail risk?

. migrate, do review

- "usually you want to perform average on disaggregated data as opposed to doing a two-pass (average on average)"

. days with multiple Issue Type R (restated) settle prices:
  IBHY: 2020-02-03, 2019-11-01, 2019-04-01
  IBIG: 2019-11-01, 2019-04-01
  - uh ohhhh... Bloomberg shows 2020-07-01 for IBIG as the S, not the R... and it also just doesn't have settle price for various maturities in early 2020
  - CFE market data page has correct settles - Rs not Ss
  - idea: use Rank table calc + filter to only show latest updated settle price for date

. send Michael update on Sarah/Krista before end of today

x message Phillip and Ben about suggestions for kids to work

. investigate IVOL_MONEYNESS for Dimitrios - basically gets you OVME->Volatility->OVDV->Data Source=LIVE Bloomberg, Tenors instead of Listed

. ask VIXTLT team what the lift would be after I we get FTP and I fix my file according to sample
  - timeframe is important - we need an exemption from the SEC to list on product (bad timing, we're also sueing them for exempting SPIKES)

. dig up Tiago alert email on Y drive removal, make sure Tiago/Dennis got all of those files

. IBHY futures settle at end of month to IBXXIBHY spot index
  - 2020-02-03 IBHY example is rounded to the wrong cent by Albert Jiminez - maybe ask him what the process is
  - Dennis actually calls around on settle date sometimes to get the files from Markit

x Symbol Id breaking dashboard
  - consider the fact that OI+Settle will include all simple Symbol Ids in existence, while Order Fill will only include those that trade
    - not the relevant culprit
  - consider that we are using ATTR(Symbol) in the Rows
    - still missing the issue I think
  - consider that you're not filtering in row by what you joined on - Symbol ID - so every measure must be aggregated?
    - nope
  - turns out you just can't do secondary data source LOD when you don't have all linked fields in view. why? I still don't understand.

o For Charlie
  . can we add previous settle and futures maturity ranks to OI+Settlement lol
    - can you literally show me how you do that on the backend
      - the way: Tableau data source download -> then when you open it you are greeted with SQL query -> once you edit it, you publish it back to be automated
        - don't want to create gunk in Tableau server though
      - Annapurna is an expert in SQL, but don't try downloading top-of-book to see her work because it's way too big, just ask her
  - Charlie is working on putting parent clearing firm into CFE Order Fill along with block trade stuff - clean!
  . Litch iBoxx charts? in particular, tracking per account OI position
    - it's in the works as Account Volume and OI (check data dictionary)
    - Charlie's been wanting to do this with VXM
      - on options side, accounts not important because omnibus, but futures you can actually track customers; Parth has customer tracking method already
      - Charlie's plan would be through Salesforce - copy stuff from Book4 into Salesforce, and then start editing only inside Salesforce in future
      . could potentially want meeting with Eileen and Michael and Litch
      - visually it looks like manual maintain would look like Tag 1 - would require Johnny Pesenti to edit Tag 1, maybe add spreadsheet upload
  . CFE Activity Dashboard - new requests posted
  . Bob Siverson - did you ever call Bob?

o For Annapurna
  . update Order Router Report with appropriate fields as layed out by Charlie in email
  . what is the affiliated firm field in DP?

*. [Tuesday] For Michael - how to do end-of-month press release form?
  - VIX: ADV up or down, OI up or down
  - iBoxx
  - Mini VIX
  - records (need better way to check for these)! block trades (first iBoxx block was Feb, maybe mention it in March since we didn't)! NOT customers! the stuff from bi-weekly analysis
    - average block trade notional size could be fun to tout - average 350 contracts in a block is $50MM, so pretty good
    - tracking percentile would be the best path towards having updated records awareness
  - it's "highlights", so only include positive/neutral sounding things lol. try looking at TAS percentage going up; GTH-RTH percentages
  - this goes external, so NO MENTIONING CUSTOMER VS. MM
  - consider quarterly comparison (best quarter in 4 quarters, in terms of ADV)
  - be aware with ADV representing notional value - in fixed income, people use longer horizons like $1 trillion in last year and it sounds great
  - today (2021-03-26) is an IBHY OI record by the way - mention that

o For Krista
  - okay so odd lots are excluded from general creation/redemption (in the non-basket)
  . next step: figure out why PCF is 28 rows and NAV Proof is 29 on 2021-03-15
  . ask Krista about exact cash flow file that would come through FTP (once it's set up)

. Paul McGeough prep
  . mention Litch, iBoxx fair value stuff
  . what were the issues with the files? dig out all the correspondence with Ojas - dates, etc.
  *. respond to schedule call week of April 12

. commercial paper is for sure a security; Ameribor broad-based check (Pallavi) needed
  - Steve Chodash will give me the data next week
  - I'm supposed to summarize characteristics of contributions to the Ameribor rate
    - e.g. how much of each day's volume is commercial paper vs. CDs? how many commercial paper issuers vs CD issuers? if we had to eliminate CDs, only use commercial paper, what would it be?
  - US commercial paper between 1-40 days to expiry
  . send Dennis universe of US-domiciled CP issuer names

. GODDAMN lost Y drive original pantaRhei access, which I use for metaballon.CleanSplines in treasury_rates_reader.py; we need a Git solution

----
iBoxx Slides Brainstorming
- send Matt Moran the iBoxx PowerPoint slides 27 and 28 for the FAGIX and OSTIX hedging studies
- fun fact: the OHLC data from download link has issues when values are corrected, e.g. 2021-03-01 expiring March maturity should be 146.42, but there are 2 rows
- these charts are straight out of Python; they are not necessarily the final charts - 9 times out of 10, presentation charts are better done through exporting data from Python and then
  hand-tweaking the aspect ratio, colors, labels in Excel into final charts; so you can view these as a glimpse at the data
- my slide deck references: 1) opening process for volatility settlements, 2) HFM CTA intelligence, 3) Litch webinar, 4) IBHY PowerPoint
*1. Correlations! I'm thinking 3-month rolling on percent returns
  - HYG/LQD
  - IBXXIBHY/IBXXIBIG
  - IBOXHY/IBOXIG
  - SPX, VIX, 5-year UST (maybe all of the USTs), EUR/USD FX rate?
  - should we do one to CDX?
2. Costs: Litch's cost spreadsheet sets a model for futures costs; for CDX, should we apply it to CWY1 futures, so then we have iBoxx futures vs. CDX futures vs. HYG?
   and maybe most importantly, how to do for TRS (Markit data?)
3. Orderbook depth would be super hard - Eileen's team will eventually tackle orderbook reconstruction in a way that's usable for us.
   average spreads (roll and outright for 1st and 2nd month) has been an ongoing project
  . Tiago wrote code for book depth (maybe for select sectors? or iBoxx)? ask him about it - what ended up happening to it?
*4. Open interest!
  - Can do overall OI with corresponding notionals
  - Eventual goal is per-account OI - data team is working on that; I can check with Parth because I think he's got clever code to do this perfectly (I think there are subtleties)
*5. Rolling ADV with corresponding notionals
...
Litch's HFM Presentation Structure:
0) Product Intro
1) Correlations
2) Volatility
3) Daily Range
4) Index Construction
5) Current Liquidity (Including Roll Liquidity)
  - roll liquidity is important since you must roll 12x a year, not just quarterly
  . what is "touch" size and spread? top of book bid/ask size*price for notional size and spread/price for bps?
- think about "tracking difference" between HYG and IBHY futures
  - buying and holding HYG is not so simple, since it is lended out, and there's expense ratio of 49-50 cents; it will underperform LESS than 49-50 cents from its TR
. think about creating additional charts on percentile rank data
. set up macros/tables into charts for these set of slide charts
. set up adjustable roll on front-month futures - try Litch's 3 days before expiry, see if that smooths out the correlations big drop beginning of year; be consistent between the 2
. keep in mind Dimitrios will leave soon - get him to wrap up fair value
----

. For Charlie
  - my percentiles code if it's useful
  - CFE Order Fill new fields
  - timeline for 1) per-account OI and 2) Pitch Feed-based orderbook reconstruction for book depth? those are both things that would help immensely on iBoxx so we need ASAP
    - if those are not your group's priorities, they will become mine, so how would I go about reconstructing the book?
  - how to remove those null columns in Historical Daily Lookup for aesthetics when using VX and iBoxx
  - NEED legacy VIX volume data in CFE Order Fill, now that I have my historical percentiles code set up
    - summary data source is realistic start
  - ETP position tracking based on Parth's stuff
  - the operator ID field in Activity Dashboard is great, but for very specific use case (but it doesn't appear to filter correctly, fix that)

- Arianne basically just cares about *which firms are causing the decrease/increase*
- iBoxx duration was an issue for someone - show some stats on that in slides

- ah jeez, what if there's stuff that's Block "B" AND "Standard"/"TAS"?
  - YUP, there's both Standard Block (occasional) and TAS Block (majority) volume; Standard ECRP (virtually all) and TAS ECRP (2019-01-17, expiry 2019-02-13 is only time)
    - so we need to eliminate the double counting there!
. use Charlie's super long code to only show latest 10 dates on my dashboard

. Percentile Rank Python Code - create_percentile_ranks.py
  . figure out structure to run (for each product) historical percentiles on each of the 12 fields (split into 2x6 since they have different historical length), plus additional "percent change" fields
    - % change fields that would be interesting are: all 6 volume-related fields, Settle, OI, (High-Low)/mean(High, Low), T Close - T Open over mean (separate +,-), T Open - T-1 Close over mean (separate +,-)
  x consider splitting Weeklys from Monthlys - would just involve counting length of Symbol I think
  . consider that we have a couple categories of percentiles:
    1. basic percentiles - just show the day's volume's rank among other days' volumes
       - this also works for prices, but much more thought has to go into how to link the expiries - always track 1st month, when to roll?
    2. return percentiles - there was a 10% increase in volume from yesterday to today, how unusual is that?
       - this also works for prices, but much more thought is needed - careful on the roll
    3. special stats percentiles - percent change from previous day of SAME expiry - settle to settle, close to open, open to close, high-low of the day as percent flux
  . so certainly when approaching prices, we should strip Weeklys out, re-create term labels, track nearest 4 months (may need to do roll by tracking first 5). then we'll just apply the daily level
    percentiles framework used for volumes onto the prices, which now are just 1 per day (though we have 4 sets of 1 per day)
    - actually, that's wrong - we care about the whole term structure - may need to make a spline or something to compare fixed point out over time with percentiles...
  . DOH, why even track futures prices then - just get the VIX Index. then when we want to go beyond VIX Index, term structure analysis (both horizontally across expiries and vertically across days)
    is next step
  x quick to-do: notional value calc comes naturally at high level where expiries are still separated and settle and volume are next to each other. sum there and extract early!
    - it comes as daily initially, and can easily be aggregated to monthly/quarterly/yearly
  x to-do to wrap-up non-price (oh my god term structure analysis) percentiles:
    x1) add % change AFTER each basic level aggregation WITHIN the volume function - we care about month-to-month % change percentile, etc.
    x2) add OI outside of function - only need daily! no aggregation needed. but we do need daily % change percentile
    x3) add notional outside of function - needs context of price per expiry in main DataFrame; aggregation needed, % change needed as well
    x4) export to XLSX with multiple sheets - one sheet for each aggregation?
    x5) run for each product, so each product gets an XLSX
  x I'm thinking ADV change percentile is not very useful compared to +/- isolation and is in fact misleading - can remove the field
  x ah jeez, the volumes sub-categories should be considered as percentages of total volume, not as pure numbers
    - version 1 ready, needs to be refactored though because it's horrible - basically need to detect case of volume sub-category and aggregate total volume cleanly
  . think about CTI, dead hours during the day
    - CTI can be solved by adding customer volume to the settlement dashboard
    . dead hours will have to be separate data source - hourly percentiles would be fun

- important note to self - Q1 2021 VIX is a good example of notional vs. volume - 3rd best quarter in terms of notional since Q2 2018, but 7th in terms of volume
- iBoxx can use notional since it's fixed income, for VIX, we usually don't
x update the press release numbers from 3/30 to 3/31
- Winton, CTA out of London, traded Eris CDX futures

x Chase on Keith Donaldson/Sarah - BlackRock FTP

----
x Prep for Paul McGeough
  0. mention Michael and Litch, iBoxx fair value stuff
     So that project is iBoxx futures around the HYG ETF. The one I'm asking about here is separate, it is the TLT VIX around the TLT ETF.
     there is some overlap, but to be clear the end goal of which these questions are a part is to use TLT ACF modified durations to calculate a basis point TLT "Treasury" VIX.
  0. I want to be clear: I don't know how ETFs work. The creation/redemption process makes it incredibly difficult for me to back out information, because any number (shares outstanding, market value)
     marked to a certain "as of" date can actually be for "the day prior to creation/redemption" or "the day after creation/redemption has completed".
     I knew even less, when I did this work 9 months ago.
  0. Send ACF methodology I've been working off: Bloomberg white paper and BlackRock memo. May be outdated, e.g. T+3 settle convention vs. T+2 now - so what's the latest status?
     Ojas's final word was basically that you guys were in process of re-evaluating the whole ACF methodology.
  1. Day-to-day spikes in historical ACF modified duration: there is a one-day "delay" between "Bond Market Value" and "NAV Market Value" causing Implied Cash to wildly fluctuate away then back again.
     My bold theory is that this is a bug that stems from the BlackRock holdings CSV confusingly listing the previous day's shares outstanding with current day's market values;
     whatever is generating the BlackRock cashflows CSV is reading it in and literally using the wrong shares outstanding to multiply the current day NAV.
     Since Implied Cash is literally a cash flow in ACF, this causes MD to fluctuate wildly.
     To be clear, my theory on what is happening is:
       1) BlackRock has some internal system where you visualize numbers comparable to those in the BlackRock holdings CSV; the shares outstanding is one day off by convention
       2) BlackRock internally generates BlackRock cashflows CSV based on this data, misinterpreting the convention;
          these are production cashflows that are sent to firms like Bloomberg who use it for ACF (as mentioned in the white paper for ACF)
       3) Bloomberg puts this ACF modified duration up on their ETF YAS page; I believe it is wrong;
          it is the blue line on the chart, and my orange line is from reverse engineering everything to swap in the "correct" shares outstanding back in step 1)
  2. When nearing the "as of" date of the cash flow file, nearest coupon cash flow seems to delay to the implied cash date. This seems to be a bug... or industry standard?
  3. How to obtain dividend distributions ahead of time in order to do replicate BlackRock cashflows CSV on ex-dates?

o Actual call
Paul was absolutely the guy to talk to. He explicitly confirmed that I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG. BOOM. But to be very discreet while they figure out how to get the IBOR number into the calculation 
process so that they can get the correct up-to-date numbers. Turns out he was suspicious of TLT MDs a long time ago, then he got a temporary assignment away, at which point I corresponded with
Ojas, who then was in parallel alerted to the error. Now they together are trying to fix it. They just could not acknowledge publically that there existed an error.
IBOR - risk of fund
ABOR - what's settle
e.g. if create/redeem done today, investment book accounts for those bonds, but the accounting book shows only what has settled, so doesn't record that until tomorrow, settlement date
re-evaluating the production processes, but not the methodology
it is T+2
119: it has to do with shares settling T+2 so ABOR can't get the number

Follow-up:
. send Paul McGeough a meeting for same time next week (finish discussing shares outstanding possibilities, hopefully with Krista knowledge; then talk about the edge case)
. ask for the updated ACF paper that is "a few weeks old"
. is it physically possible to get the appropriate IBOR number - can we run through a detailed timeline in a trade day on when numbers are generated for IBOR and ABOR?
. side note maybe: how do people get cashflows
. timeline for fixing things - it doesn't seem that hard?
. get him to send white paper
----

. Krista response

o Ameribor Commercial Paper Update from Art Reinstein
  - Wilmer Haile is investigating
  - broad-based index does not have to be under jurisdiction of SEC
  - test: look to each individual issuance and verify that it's over a certain amount ($250MM)
    - watch out for duplicative issuances - what even is that? - DTCC Tim says:
      initial issuance IPA issues to dealer who then distributes to customer/client or custodian (non-dealer) (custodian for money market funds etc.);
      IPA to dealer is what we want? but what could happen is dealer moves commercial paper to a custodian and then custodian does something with it, and same thing is logged twice
  - DTCC knows the amount, but it's not included in the data we receive
    - they are not sure if they want to give that data to us

. tell Michael about Ben's guy and Stevie's brother

. download intraday Pitch feed and lay out the reconstruction myself
  - class objects representing orders, identity being the exec ID or whatever, sort value being price and then time
  - maintain this sorted list of objects as the "book"

. correlations
  - write Bloomberg to adjustable roll function to easily work with returns; check old code, I've definitely done something similar before
  - generate correlations
  - read 3 articles (importantly Adam Grimes)
  - write spreads code to profile roll health to maybe see if there's a historically better roll date than 3 before expiry

- WOW pandas bug:
  pd.Timestamp('2021-03-31')-13*pd.DateOffset(months=1)
  does not do the same thing as
  pd.Timestamp('2021-03-31')-pd.DateOffset(months=13);
  the latter is preferable, as it gives 2020-02-29, the actual end-of-month. this could be a pull request!

o Danny's VIXTLT Meeting
  - John's questions:
    1) vega volumes
      . send to Danny the code
    2) TLT options quality on our markets
    3) basis point - where even is that right now
    4) relevant Jira tickets

. low-key it is an issue that I can't look at DS-117 or any DS tickets

x add test cases for Treasury futures maturities (2 kinds), quarterly_only, iBoxx futures maturities
. refresh next_treasury_maturity function to use next_expiry? solution may be to iterate until the expiry goes past previous one

o VIX Volumes Michael - Investigate ETPs
  - AUMs changing is tied to TAS
  - L.XBL.10265 showing up for CTI 4 and 2?
  - what is RBFC?
  - getting ETP roll volume is a slight extension of the VIX ETP equivalent volume code; needs SPVXSTR
  . need to know how many shares we expect UVXY and VXX to trade from roll, expand to the other ETPs as well
    - what's the reduction from ETPs losing AUM
  - may need to get BZX UVXY data
  - eventually - delta that trades in VIX options, how much delta hedging goes on each day; e.g. 15,000 each day, how does it affect VIX futures
  - Rich Repetto journalist? remarked that VIX ETPs have rebounded from trough levels, but now we're back at the trough
  - GTH: Michael needs to be able to answer that question; firm activity: higher or lower, we need to know; GTH+CTI(2&4; in 2, isolate the big banks like Barclays): we need to know
  - Michael pulls up member invoices on website - it has volumes of MPIDs, should tie out to Tableau; can calc RPCs ($1.47 for customers, etc.); Michael made pivot table CTI 2 sum of volume, sum of fee, RPC
  - does realized vol die at noon or something? do hourly to see when things stop and maybe why

. automate expiry dates for something Dennis will send you

o [Middle of week of April 12?] Dennis and Michael Ameribor To-Do List (2nd, after top priority of VIX ETPs)
  . step 1) validate/replicate Ameribor index level numbers, since we haven't ever even done that (current Ameribor term 30)
    - they weight it, so we need the amounts in addition to DTCC file (DTCC alone cannot do it, also need AFX transaction detail)
    . Steve Chodash will get me access to AFX transaction data
    - Dennis really wants this calc to come from AFX eventually
    - Dennis has replicated commercial paper for a given day based on their rules
  . step 2) from last week, want weighting of commercial paper, CDs, etc.; how many issuers
    - note that 1-40 day is much bigger than 2-40 because overnight accounts for huge portion; overnight skews things big time
  . note all the ways you can slice and dice the inputs into the index, e.g. what's the actual weighted days to maturity? like 1.5 (because of overnight) or 30; maybe expand to 1-50
    - "tweaks" to the calculation to get alternate index levels, so we can tell Sandor "let's just tweak it, it's basically the same thing"; look at March 2020 for extremes
    - Bloomberg's BSBY uses same inputs as Ameribor, but bond transactions (skewed to longer term) included to fill out term structure beyond 6 month point;
      commercial paper is a lynchpin for every LIBOR-replacement index
    - we'll have to look at some kind of capping (no more than 5% on a given day, etc.)

- note to self: operator IDs have bizarre capitalizations - normalize those in future volumes dashboards

- Asahd Bhati - equity newsletter? check it out
- Charlie: live "revenue" field integrated into CFE Order Fill or similar data source; would make revenue-based work easier (for QBR, etc.)
- AUM in UVXY back to November levels
. chase Charlie on backfilling VX volumes

x send email separately to Sarah Cummings separately to ask what we should do about Keith

o Eileen Data Platform User Kickoff
  - Andrew Paulman is the guy setting up the environment and the box for server access
  - goal: use DP for analytics, not just for Tableau
  - individual quotes (for VIX, etc.) - Andrew is working on a way to do this that doesn't involve having all of that data sitting there
    - it's a terabyte of data a day for quotes, so it must be a different workflow
    - not just about cost of cloud storing (cheap), it's about the cost/time for computing
  - we can put in requests for use cases, that's what the Teams chat forum is for
  - PID Data Considerations section - that's where we can outline use cases for creating data sources (raise it to the PID owner)
    . I should ask about old VIX data in a data source
      - could be 1) a static data source that's consistent with itself or 2) a merged and updated thing separate from CFE Order Fill
    - index platform, all index values go straight into DP
      - John Hiatt: if it's internal dissemination does it still go into DP? Eileen: Yes!
  - the other big thing we care about is building the book, but we know Eileen's group currently has no plans for that

- VIX, IBHY, IBIG all have contract multipliers of 1000; VXM=100; AMW=35, AMB1=50, AMB3=25
  - on Bloomberg, 7-Day Ameribor Week x (1-5) is xO1 Comdty; 1-Month Ameribor is MRE1 Comdty; 3-Month Ameribor is MER1 Comdty

----
x iBoxx Generic 1st and 2nd Stitching
Day 5 (exp-3) price, Day 6 (exp-2) return, Day 6 (exp-2) price, Day 7 (exp-1) return, Day 7 (exp-1) price, Day 8 (final) return, Day 8 (maturity) price
DAY 5 IS THE MAGIC 3 BEFORE EXPIRY ROLL DATE - imagine sell 1st month and buy 2nd month on that day, then 2nd month Day 6 return becomes applicable,
then because Bloomberg swaps 2nd month into 1st month on Day 9, we have to account for that by calculating Day 9 return from 2nd month Day 8 price and 1st month Day 9 price
IN OTHER WORDS, mat-3 do roll cost, then mat-3 to mat-2 return done with Bloomberg 2nd month, then for mat to mat+1 return need to stitch 2nd month price to 1st month price
NOTICE that it's not JUST price or JUST return - the selling and buying screws with price intra-day, and the Bloomberg switch screws with return consistency
example verify: done, I just won't write it here

x some holidays are included in iBoxx on Bloomberg and just give NaNs. only some. that's annoying and needs to be filtered
x GODDAMN Bloomberg shows the wrong maturity settle prices. we need to go in manually to correct every single one with values from IBXXIBHY
x send to Hemal
. send as email to Litch and Michael
. send to Pallavi and Tiago eventually
- think about rolling 1/3 each day, like SPVXSTR methodology
. ah Jesus, HYG change has NaN on 2018-12-05 - need to manually eliminate Bush Day of Mourning (and anything else) where the two DatetimeIndexes don't line up!
. read Adam Grimes to be informed
. what to do about 2021-04 correlation decoupling?? switch to NAV?
  . 2020 to end of 2021-03 crop for now, investigate pricing spreads and/or index holdings (ask Dimitrios?) later
. talk to Dennis about settlement values (missing and wrong) and to correct history
  - figure out how things work currently - it may be a timing misinterpretation
. 122 to 126 towards beginning of IBHY
. IBIG 2020-7-14 - could it have been a new market maker? Fed announced buying LQD?
  . check SMARTS to see who forced the price correction
. next step is the time-weighted evaluation
----

- Eagle7 responsible for 2018-09-28 faulty 2nd term 122 amidst 126, should do something about that

- VIX ETP roll
  - want to be out of front month completely (0 exposure) day BEFORE maturity
  - how fast you roll each day depends on how many days there are in the month
  - it has NOTHING to do with SPVXSTR lol it's just on the same page in the VIX_market_review.xlsx spreadsheet for some reason
    - the actual data needed is VIX futures front 3 months + list of VIX maturities; you then calculate weighting and the weighted price and how much VIX is needed for each future

. for Michael
  . how does UVXY price work; also NAV is mislabeled right?

- Susq change in position limits for UVXY? when they calc they look at your net longs and shorts (combo options on ETF), take ETF hedges to figure out which way you're going
  - recall that Keith from ProShares said they raised create fees to stop the AUM increase
  - Susq said the giant $500MM creates were them for position limits - they keep VIX futures to hedge exposure, but then that doesn't offset their ETF options
  - CTC, Wolverine may also show up as "replicating ETF exposures using VIX futures"
  - conjecture: Goldman, JP, Barclay, Susq are in there at the end of the day, may be not only hedging their VIX options, but now we know also VIX ETP options

o Michael VIX ETP
  - Brian Schell: can we get a better grasp on VIX ETP impact
  - can we establish a high end and low end for VIX futures volume
  - step 1 is seriously get Parth's data so we can look at his valuable stuff

. write function for pulling/creating a pre-rolled front-month future (wouldn't be just a timeseries, could be multiple) from Bloomberg

- oh god, UVXY is an ETF while VXX is an ETN; in spreadsheet, ETN uses price*shares for net assets, while ETF uses NAV*shares?
  - that's not good? - ETNs have indicative values too (not technically NAV, but often called "NAV") for judging daily worth
  - note that my current formula does PX_LAST to get vega per share - should I be using NAV instead?
  - fun fact: because ETPs in the beginning have huge NAV and few shares, the Bloomberg shares-NAV-assets triangle is wildly imprecise
    - shares rounds to nearest 1000, and each share's NAV can be $1MM, so in beginning best to use total assets I think!
- note that the rebalance percents are for end-of-day - 0, 1 for 1st and 2nd AFTER EOD Tuesday before Wednesday of maturity
. oh god, not safe to use total assets vs. shares*NAV (or price) because in the beginning of ETP, those don't match; which is better?
  - around 2017, start to converge
- Bloomberg is all sorts of inconsistent - need to manually take out holidays before doing day-to-day change
- UVXY 5 missing Bloomberg info dates: 2017-02-18, 2017-06-03, 2017-09-30, 2018-03-31, 2018-12-22
  - okay lmao these are all Saturdays?? Bloomberg whyyyy
. in VXX A, FUND_TOTAL_ASSETS is only given once a month at end-of-month; that wreaks havoc with my formula - I must change it to use NAV*shares instead
  - 2012-10-04 was when they started doing daily - not too bad total assets
. what happened to VXX B on 2019-01-15 (Tuesday) and 2018-01-17 (Wednesday)?
  - VXX B 2018 Feb 5 has no NAV

. send email with 2 codes to Brian Eck for Tiago
  . get Tiago to send another follow-up?

- Michael used the 85% ETP equiv-VIX futures correlation as a "this is around how much gets hedged"
- remember that multiplier effect is from high-frequency guys, separate from ETP vega volume hedging and ETP roll
  - non-open interest volume from high-frequency MMs

- Ameribor is next priority after VIX QBR/board report btw

o Parth VIX Work
  . question: how are you getting "users"? he has "ProShares" Psi8000 through Phillip Capital
  . what are John's new categories? you guys talk too fast lol
    1) ETP issuers, 2) firms trading ETP, 3) TAS, 4) firms trading ETP options, 5) firms holding VIX futures instead of ETPs then having to deal with position limits
  . chase Parth on code for identifying PROTOP, etc.
  . CMTA - one clearing firm trading on behalf of other clearing firm - needs special attention?

- Wolverine Trading, LLC's WSOFT account is the one that does massive TAS - huge activity starts 2019-03-15

x try using Parameters with Filter to Latest 5 Dates! otherwise, can't "disable" the filter aesthetically
  - yup: make parameter that is a verb, have it be chosen as a boolean; then have 3rd calc field be the "filter" field - filter it to be true, but have its value be the T/F
  - note that when blending data sources, you MUST do this 3-part process in the original data source; otherwise, you'll have null and * as filter possibilities

. why are there block trades occurring at 4:48pm lol:

- Litch's roll cost spreadsheet uses "actual start date" to start at 0... and then it goes both forward in time and back (opposite signs though - watch out)

. Annapurna response after finishing going through her dashboards

. Options Institute: send to Litch the data so he can collate and finalize the graphs
  - focus on what you have - whack across something today
    . apply perfect front month IBHY and IBIG to every permutation of rolling correlations
    . fix up and export percentiles CSVs and share with Litch (PrdDevSharedDB? add Litch/Hemal/Sarj and Charlie)
    . try to get CDX volumes through SDRVCDHY Index, SDRVCDIG Index
    *. figure out why correlations diverge - first check prices, then check constituents (dang may need to write code)
    . [pipe dreams]: 1) finish studying Annapurna stuff and do something with liquidity
                       . investigate top-of-book (can't do book depth at moment) notional iBoxx vs. HYG/LQD
                         - even TOB shouldn't look too bad
                       . basis points of futures spread vs. HYG/LQD spread
                     2) do time-weighted roll yield
                     3) revive hedging code for John Angelos
                     4) check SMARTS for IBIG 2020-07-14 - what happened and when and who?
                       - edit 2021-07-20: Michael is looking at SMARTS: 2020-07-13's 145.25 doesn't appear in SMARTS! doesn't appear on 2020-07-10 either
                         - so it wasn't a market maker price-correcting - our historical prices are just wrong?
                           - looking at website, it acknowledges that day's range was in the 147s, but then our official settle was 145 LMAO WHAT
                         - CONFIRMED: help desk was blindly matching returns to LQD
  - have some more work on my end liquidity/roll liquidity
  - what exactly do we need on CDX? just correlations to cash index + maybe volumes; Litch has sent tickers for JUST volume i.e. PX_LAST gets you volume by thousand
  - stick on the Osterweis hedging stuff
  . ask Pallavi for the constituent work, refer to dashboard stuff
  . price thing or constituent thing - 2021-04 correlation breakdown in IBHY

o Charlie latest
  - backfilling VX volumes - Jira?
    - Charlie talked to Annapurna, she is backfilling for per-account OI, account symbol CTI code date/expiration is there, kind of slim but going ahead with it
    - Parth can confirm - dealing with accounts is very manual; he has a mapping across history for miscategorizations
    - next step: I can request the spread, block/ecrp, standard vs. TAS in separate project if needed
  - timeline for per-account OI?
    - ready in a couple weeks - fairly soon
  - can I put in Jira for Pitch Feed-based orderbook reconstruction for book depth?
    . make the ticket
  - CFE Activity Dashboard - new requests posted
    - the operator ID field in Sheet 2 is great, but for very specific use case (but it doesn't appear to filter correctly, fix that)
    - no work on that yet, maybe next week
  - Bob Siverson block report - did you ever call Bob?
    - maybe next week
  - affiliated firm?
  - how to remove those null columns in Historical Daily Lookup for aesthetics when using VX and iBoxx

- Michael talked to Barclays desk doing high touch execution for VIX etc., mainly in TAS, and they saw discrepancy in Bloomberg VWAP number
  with our VWAP
  - Bloomberg's page is AQR: UXK1->AQR

- Adam H. Grimes - when rolling futures, you can do 1) "unadjusted" which shows levels correctly but misleads on returns, 2) "difference-adjusted"
  which are the de factor standard from many vendors and preserve point value swings but misleads on percent returns, 3) "ratio-adjusted" which
  get the percent returns but not the point value changes or prices
  - what you want actually depends on how your system tracks P&L: early software focused on points/ticks won or lost, so had to do difference-adjusted
    - if you track percentages and returns, ratio-adjusted is the way
  - charting is a legitimate issue: if you scale with ratio-adjusted, price swings in the past may look misleading! there's more to a price number than
    just the percent difference from the previous number; unadjusted may literally be the way to go depending on the point you're making
    - however, this does pretty much disprove support/resistance (technical analysis)

- % change in bond price predicted for parallel bp shift in ACF yield = % change of price of ETF + MD*(change in ACF yield) + Convexity*(change in ACF yield)^2/2
. you should code convexity now that we have the formula; maybe also DV01?; also, maybe the direct formula for MD?

x VXM Update 2021-04
  - Percentiles
    - VXM volume at its all time low - 10,089 (29% drop from 14,247)
      - compare to next lowest November with 11,212
    - OI at its all time high by far - average daily OI of 11,634 (63% increase from previous month)
      - previous high was October with 9349
      - 2021-04-16 VXM OI record date - 15,670
      - as we've said before, OI each month is a steady build into the VIX maturity, then huge drop as they convert to big VIX;
        same this month, just starting at a really high level; not sure why
  - Account analysis on what's going on with volumes
    - let's start with the existing core vs. new experimenters: we can observe 2 things:
      1) there is a historic low number of new accounts
      2) both the new accounts and the existing accounts trading are doing significantly lower volume per account
      - both of those point to April being a dull month for vol trading
        - indeed, big VIX ADV is down 12% as well (29% in VXM)
      - we have been relying on a huge influx of new accounts every month, and that's where we took the loss this month compared
        to past months
      - one silver lining: the active existing accounts and volume per account decreased by much less than the new customers,
        i.e. they proportionally accounted for much more volume and were "resilient"
    - CTI page: observe that CTI 2 vs. CTI 4 volume ratio surprisingly remained the same
      - MM/customer multiplier relationship held firm - indicates that root cause of decrease in volume is not MM, but customers
    - Firms page: IB and ABN both took proportional hits on new accounts;
      the other big guy tasty surprisingly had an increased number of new accounts - I wonder if it's from some kind of marketing
      - IB+ABN+tasty+StoneX = 89% of April volume
      - ADM Investor Services had some existing accounts that suddenly did big volume around the roll (120, 168, 264);
        interesting to see - jumped out because most other firms had big decrease in volume and they doubled their previous month
  x ah shoot, I forgot the CTI 4 ADV

x iBoxx Update [did not give]
  - very unfortunate that this meeting fell 4 days before maturity - decent amount of volume isn't here yet
  - Percentiles
    - IBHY volume actually 2nd highest ever, OI highest ever by a long shot; IBIG highest on both
    - however, it's not actually rosy underneath
  - NO new accounts this month - I hope I don't have my data wrong here
  - volumes may be off because we're still 4 days out from maturity, but this may be the first month with no new customers since 2018-11
  - so far, customer volume is IB (8 for 347, 26%), SocGen (2 for 308, 23%), Goldman (1 for 290, 22%), EDF (1 for 240, 18%), and that's 90% and then JPM and UBS with 5% each

- remember the ACF example - modify it to add in iBoxx for comparison once we get iBoxx futures borrow rate
- ABN AMRO VXM is actually just 99% TD Ameritrade (on CFE at least)
  x break ABN's TD accounts out from regular ABN accounts (very few of latter)
- TD has a whole business interacting with RIAs - that's the TD side that shows up in SPX, not retail
  - JJ from TD is tight with Tilly and Arianne, he's being persuasive that retail is just a matter of money/education away
- E-mini retail is 5%, and they pay out the nose for it, and CME still isn't making money on the retail
- TD is a rent-seeker - undercut prices, then get paid by exchanges
  - the money they make does not make it back to the customers - Citadel pays for Robinhood, Robinhood keep the change
x update the QBR studies answers
. realized vol is good for percentile ranks!
*. QBR by mid-morning Thursday
x make remaining firms_pivot sheet with # accounts
x Michael dinner

. Annapurna today!!
  . finish looking at her dashboards, put together simple version for quick reference
  . look back into defining 1st term, 2nd term, etc. liquidity

- remember that you learned all about Power Query today - you can load in CSV with more than 1MM rows - just have to load specially in Excel

x add buy vs. sell in VX_master_pivot; maybe also the capacity F vs. C
  - I did not do the latter because kind of ambiguous for futures
. check with Parth on table that can identify Account - where did you get that again?

- diverging ETP vega vs. VIX futures is legit returns being positive vs. negative, and it wasn't just one outlier date

x Charlie
  x ask about capacity C vs. F (also, has that been removed? may be called "Origin" - from flags)
    - Origin pre-migration; BATS Tech calls it Capacity
    - supposed to be marked accurately on each trade
    - weird on futures - people mainly refer to CTI; not as descriptive as in options where there are 6-7 (could be MM or C or F)
  x clarify about "Clearing Firm" (is that EFID) vs. "Parent Clearing Firm"
    - remember that Clearing Firm is specific to the trade - the EFID is used for accounting each trade - and Parent Clearing is linked in from the exec firm itself
  . ask about Parth's account identification ability - Charlie says it's not a DP thing
    *. keep in mind Parth's account ID dictionary and Litch's Book 4 could both go into Salesforce
       . contact Litch as guinea pig
       . ask Parth to clarify and separate "confirmed" vs. "speculating"
  . affl_firm_name is prob name for parent clearing - ask for 4-letter code from Annapurna!

x April monthly volume press release
x add Customer to dashboard and to Futures Percentiles
*- your workflow for SWAT meetings is now track_distinct_accounts.py->update spreadsheet, then create_percentile_ranks.py->look at ADV and ADOI, then open VXM dashboard for OI visual

o Paul McGeough Part 2
- Aladdin gets the position files, iShares and Aladdin are 2 separate entities in BlackRock, long story short data lives in iShares but it's proprietary until
  - we want immediately after close share info, it's not public
  - Aladdin gets the risk of the portfolio live, but not the share info
- issue #2 - Paul explains it's all in having to wait 2 days before receiving cash - no cash can come before implied cash date! that's the point of implied cash date
  . need to make this fix in my code

x bug in my manual accounts spreadsheets - on days with no trades, spreadsheet ignores from average, whereas we should average the 0 in
  - for iBoxx and VIX something happens every day, so we can just fill the blanks, but what about Ameribor, where there are days with NO TRADE ENTRIES
    - actually wrong: you can't just fill in the blanks; our ADV calc uses distinctcount(trade dates), so if some dates are missing, that number is smaller
  - in code, absolutely need to obtain "number of trade days in month" separately from the index and use it to divide sum total
    - potential messy solution: must add "# trade days in month/quarter/year" as additional columns; messy because it doesn't naturally scale
  *- NO REAL SOLUTION - JUST WATCH OUT FOR IT

x follow-up with Paul since meeting was rushed
x follow-up with Sarah
. schedule 15 minute meeting with Brian Eck when I send that email with the VIXTLT code

. give thought to Dimitrios leaving - who's gonna take his code, how are we gonna pick up iBoxx Fair Value, ask him about the correlation breakdown, schedule meetup
  . may need to schedule another call to get updated on Fair Value
    . ask about what I need to talk to Yoshiki about
    *. schedule in the next week!!
  . ping him - he's in NY right now, last day is end of month

x Steve Chodash April 16 email respond and prompt
  x need to first consider what we received previously

x add Trade Date filter to Historical Daily Breakdown
  x consider showing "all" trade dates not just relevant, to help efficiency

. iBoxx Update for April 2021 (sending in only as message)
  - Percentiles
    - IBHY ADV (all CTIs) actually 2nd highest ever at 1244, OI highest ever by a long shot at 1531; IBIG highest on both
      - show percentiles
      - show OI chart - highlight that it's month-on-month OI highs
  - NO new accounts this month
    - first month with no new customers since 2018-11
  - Customer Volume is: Goldman (1 for 1792 (Union rolled on 4/27), 58%),
                        IB (9 for 436 (small, regular trades) , 14%),
                        SocGen (2 for 330 (CAREBEN), 11%),
                        EDF (1 for 268 (Toews), 9%),
    and that's 92%; UBS with another 128 contracts from Barings making up 4%
    - note that 4 trades (2xUnion, CAREBEN, Toews) made up 2306 contracts i.e. 75% total customer volume

. Wolverine question about EOD TAS issue - talking to him on Thursday
  . use Data Analytics for this one since it's low stakes

o Steve Chodash/DTCC - Kinetics File Questions
  - 5:10pm Eastern (4:10pm Chicago) final settlement calc time for DTCC
    - remember we're trying to put out end-of-day around 6pm (couple minutes after 6pm)
    - 3:45pm DTCC stops accepting, 4:10pm output?, reference files can show up after
  - last couple of fields can't be filled in prior to final settle file (i.e. real-time intraday doesn't have it)
    - those fields crucial for filtering
  - another fun fact: the files don't have a time of transaction for some reason, which is bad for us trying to filter for cutoffs
  - remember "funded by" time is what we filter by (I think)

o Dennis quick call about Ameribor
  - white papers - are they up to date?
  - what does AFX do? I was thinking they were like an exchange trading the debt, but they are actually creating the "debt", is that correct?
  - I was under impression there are 3 types of things that go into Ameribor - loans, commercial paper, CDs
    - what does it mean for a commercial paper to be issued and settled on the same day? what has happened to it?
  - next step is look at Art email and answer them
  . ask Dennis - is there timing info for DTCC CP/CD data? on the call they said no right?

o Al Flosi TAS question
  - what time does it thin out?
    A: 2:50pm, go back 6 months book was fairly symmetrical bid-offer; but last month/week, it's become 0 bid (below 5k) is much smaller than 1 offer (15k);
       not alarm yet, but noticeable; total traded volume at each price each day - always somewhat skewed toward 0s, but spreads would balance it out,
       but now it's way way more 0s than 1s; if that continues, MMs may lose liquidity, may need to drop to -1
  - Al uses Bloomberg and pulls up all TAS trades and exports to Excel
  - yesterday 2021-05-12, can see (go to 2:58:30)
  . things to check for: are the usual TAS guys just doing everything earlier? or are they going to be affected; what's the root cause? does this happen a lot?
  . remember Al thinks this may be caused by VWAP vs. midpoint - can we see if that's an issue?

- Barclays just uses one account for VXX - it's the one active in TAS CTI 2

x [WAITING] continue Eileen thread - can we get it bespoke now?
  - remember the deliverable is for Art, so the March-present matters

- Charlie
  . can we make TAS 0/0.01 instead of the actual price? i.e. subtract manually
  . Action(Dynamic Measure)
  . Ameribor calculation: AFX data (being added to DP)
    - Paresh is the leader of batch team that actually deals with data
  . project: TAS exploration

o Art Reinstein Deliverable Meeting
  - "consolidators" - doing loans stuff on behalf of banks, so hard to count actual # of AFX banks
  - AMT1 (term-30) vs. AMB1 vs. SOFR vs. one-month LIBOR
    - need a little bit of text explaining correlation (see Art's email 2021-05-14)
  - Ameribor itself is a thing
  - AMB1 current 1-month Ameribor backward-looking, using the Ameribor itself
  . my deliverables 1) the list of questions, 2) the calculation spreadsheet
    - don't give borrower/lender names

- AFX data on DP spans 2021-01-04 to 2021-04-29
- Ameribor replication
  - DTCC piece: CDs and CPs
    1) filter >= $1MM principal
    2) boolean issue date == settle date, filter to only True
    3) filter to duration 2-40
    4) filter to Interest Rate Type F (fixed), not V (variable)
    5) filter to America
    6) filter to FIN (financial)
    7) collect Interest Rate and Days to Maturity fields
    8) calculate Dollar Basis Point Value (principal*days to mat)
    9) calculate total sum DBPV for each day
    10) calculate percent weight of DBPV in day
    11) calculate weighted interest rate (weighted by percent DBPV, which is itself weighted by days to maturity)
    12) AMERIBOR Term-30 = that weighted sum
  *x AFX loans piece: I have no idea how to do the equivalent
    - Steve: quantity is in millions (10 means $10MM), price shows bp*1000 (10,000 means 10bp i.e. 0.1%);
             must check "funded at" and "busted at" fields - no busted, must be funded;
             all loans are overnight (1 day duration, 1 day to maturity), though in theory we need to be ready for 30-day
    - that gives us all we need I think: principal, duration, interest rate, days to maturity
  - special pieces:
    1) need to add up principal to check for >= $25bn, extending days beyond 5 if needed
    2) after calculating, need to apply safeguard check for >+-250bp from calculated rate, omit transactions, re-calculate
- "combined data" in code: need to
  1) drop one of dated/settle to simplify
  2) copy normalized funded_at date to date
  3) sort by date, principal, days to maturity
  4) go back and set Duration (Days) as 1 or 30 for the AFX half
  5) rename instrument to Product Type
  6) stylize Borrower Name, Lender Name (to match Issuer Name)
  7) drop Maturity Date, Settlement Amount
  8) only 2 additional fields will be matched_at and funded_at, so stylize those if desired
  9) order of crucial columns: ['Date', 'Product Type', 'Principal Amount', 'Duration (Days)', 'Days To Maturity', 'Interest Rate']
     DTCC filters: ['Dated/ Issue Date', 'Settlement Date', 'Interest Rate Type', 'Country Code', 'Sector Code']
     DTCC nice to have: ['Issuer Name', 'CUSIP', 'Maturity Date', 'Settlement Amount']
     AFX filters: ['instrument', 'busted_at', 'funded_at']
     AFX nice to have: ['borrower_name', 'lender_name', 'matched_at', 'price', 'quantity', 'trade_id', 'borrower_id', 'lender_id']
- note that instrument_id matches up with PREVIOUS DAY'S instruments.csv; is there a similar issue with institutions?
. what does it mean for Issue Date = Settlement Date? why include only those in calculation?
. what is "Settlement Amount"?
. what is "bilateral", etc.?
  - correspondent bank - broker on behalf of smaller banks; did check processing, excess funds lending
- rates look to be annualized
- 6 trades on 2019-04-01 appear to be unfunded despite not being busted (every other time funded_at is blank, it's busted)
- Steve Chodash gave me quick login: https://prod.theamericanfinancialexchange.com/ gzhang@cboe.com Cboe123!
  - Benchmark Average Rates are the rates
    - it sucks because only goes back to 2021-03-15 lmao why?
  - Dtcc Values give a breakdown
    - note: despite being called "DTCC values", has both DTCC and AFX
    - note: gives weighted average PER DAY; you have to manually aggregate per 5 days:
            day_5_rate = (daily_rate_1*day_1_total_dbpv + ... + daily_rate_5*day_5_total_dbpv) / (day_1_total_dbpv + ... + day_5_total_dbpv)
    - note: "total bpv" seems to be scaled down a factor of 3,600,000x? what on earth?
      - 360 day convention, 10,000bp conversion
    x how do they do the re-calc safeguard +-250bp?
      - update that's apparently not how it works
    . what happens if re-calc volume below $25bn?
x ah I did not yet implement the safeguard, and it does come into play e.g. 2021-02-24 rate 0.106986 rules out 8 CPs (across 4 days)
  - update: I had a "wrong" understanding of the safeguard - should be filtering each day's transactions using previous day's AMBOR30T
    - but yeah it does come into play a lot
- figured out that overnight is days to maturity 1 and rate 0.14 is annualized 360 days i.e. $150MM returns $150,000,583.33 next day
- first batch of data: usable AFX goes from 2016-01-15 to 2021-03-19; DTCC goes from 2016-01-04 to 2021-03-23
  - I will try to calculate Ameribor term-30 from 2016-01-22 (5th day of data) to 2021-03-19
- 2016-06-03 seems to be start of "consistent" over $25bn principal, though there are trouble periods 2016-Q4, 2018-Q2, 2020
x ask Steve Chodash about the "one-month in arrears compounding Ameribor rate", because I can't find it on Bloomberg
  - AMBOX/AMBTX are the actual indexes the Ameribor futures settle to
    - update: they are calculated super weird - they "reset" the accumulation at beginning of each month - NOT valid for reference use,
      use only for settlement on settlement date basically
  - LiveVol has them, but not Bloomberg
  - Cboe website->Indices->CSMI->Products->AMBOX

o Another Ameribor call
  - again, no new loans between early and final, but final will have missing fields on those loans that allow us to say "US, Financial"
    - I am not 100% sure on which time we're talking about - 4:10pm is the final I think, 2pm is the early?
    - 2pm file isn't available until 2:45pm (Chicago time)
    - no real information advantage though, but we have to disclose it
      - for this reason though, we'll leave it at 2pm

x Keith Botti (ProShares) Morgan Stanley liquidity questions
  - RTH is all that matters
  - make table, split 1st and 2nd term
  - split TAS from standard
  - split spreads from outright
  - on charts, overlay VIX
  *- HEY. COMMUNICATE WHEN THINGS INEVITABLY GET DELAYED. GOOD EXAMPLE IS WHAT HAPPENED HERE: YOU MISSED THE CALL THAT WAS SET UP NEXT MORNING.
  - 1-7
  - book depth
  - explain notes in email, offer quick call to walk through
  x part 2: use weighted bid/ask price to do notionals!

x follow up on Viet
. Brian Eck fix and send

. migrate to OPO by end of month ah jeez

x Charlie
  x Bob's thing
    - order summary has quote port and order port
    - join order summary to order fill which has maker vs. taker classification
  x submitted Jira ticket
  x can we go over the updates from the Data & Analytics User Group meeting?
    - Andrew Pullman making easy query Python library - solve question of pulling data easy
  x when do the Tableau data tables update? 8-10am?
    - some on schedule with underlying tables, but early in the morning generally; Charlie doesn't have concrete time off top of head
    - C1 dataset gets delayed sometimes
  - access layer is now being tested internally, not available yet as of 2021-06-18
    - can now do stuff day by day inside Python Jupyter, order_summary stuff

- Term (based on DTE) needs table calc config of "at the level expire_date", "restarting every trade_date", MUST CHECK MARK EVERY ROW
  - actually, the trick may be order them by visual, then "restarting every" rightmost before "at the level"
- CFE TOB Market Quality Summary (Annapurna): VX and VXT complex=True has duration_type NULL
  - does that mean Weeklys do not have spreads?
- wow, so for some reason, visually, in Tableau, float(time) shows whole numbers even though fractions of days are in play
  - this is from breaking down Annapurna's code - she does a clever, invisible trick to have adjustable time lengths of aggregation
    (Custom Time Calc parameter->Time Calc Cust Val->Time Calc group)
  - WAIT Time Calc group is definitely broken - different number of 12s (9) from 10s (8) from 14s (7)
. must do "average" aggregation because we have 15-minute divisions? yikes what are implications for average? does weighting take care of imbalance?

o Dimitrios
  - go over his old emails
  - base market value doesn't check out - Dimitrios never figured it out, so need to figure out difference between base market value and market value
  - calculate_ibxxibhy_history() is the model - it replicates IBXXIBHY
  - need to figure out why IBXXIBHY has stuff that's not in HYG lol should be strict subset at least at rebalance?
  - can trace days on which IBXXIBHY constituents fall out of HYG

x make sure Art knows where you're at: 1) getting chart ticker from Steve, 2) finishing code to correct calculation, 3) stats after calculation correct
  x ask someone for how to download from LiveVol from web interface
    - Anshul had a way but you had to do an export per day; his code interface was the best way
x ask Steve about DTCC data
. get correlations/book depth!

x reach out casually to interns again, ask about part-time
x check access to PrdDevSharedDB on OPO PC - see what's wrong with Michael's

x schedule with Yoshiki once deadlines start petering out

. New York Fed User Guide to SOFR 2021 Feb
  - currently on page 10
  - learned about compound vs. simple averaging - no difference at low rates short period
    - simple averaging suprisingly widely used, but fundamentally bad - doesn't account for time value of money compounding, just as if it's fixed principal
      every day, then sum all the interest
    - compound is apply return rate to every day; remember to divide annualized rate by 360 (US convention) to get daily return

x VXM Update 2021-05 (through 24th) [INCOMPLETE - I GAVE IT WITHOUT UPDATING THE TEXT BELOW]
  - VIX index spikes: 27.6 - May 12th (Elon Musk tweets Tesla will no longer accept bitcoin as payment to save the planet)
                      22.2 - May 19th (China bans institutional crypto services)
  - Percentiles
    - VXM volume at 70th percentile - 20,800 (103% rise from 10,241, lowest volume month)
    - OI at 60th percentile - average daily OI of 8570 (24% drop from 11,288, which was by far highest month)
      - 11k to 5k drop at VIX maturity, will rise back up this coming week
      - as we've said before, OI each month is a steady build into the VIX maturity, then huge drop as they convert to big VIX;
  - Account analysis on what's going on with volumes
    - let's start with the existing core vs. new experimenters: we can observe 2 things:
      1) there is a historic low number of new accounts
      2) both the new accounts and the existing accounts trading are doing significantly lower volume per account
      - both of those point to April being a dull month for vol trading
        - indeed, big VIX ADV is down 12% as well (29% in VXM)
      - we have been relying on a huge influx of new accounts every month, and that's where we took the loss this month compared
        to past months
      - one silver lining: the active existing accounts and volume per account decreased by much less than the new customers,
        i.e. they proportionally accounted for much more volume and were "resilient"
    - CTI page: observe that CTI 2 vs. CTI 4 volume ratio surprisingly remained the same
      - MM/customer multiplier relationship held firm - indicates that root cause of decrease in volume is not MM, but customers
    - Firms page: IB and ABN both took proportional hits on new accounts;
      the other big guy tasty surprisingly had an increased number of new accounts - I wonder if it's from some kind of marketing
      - IB+ABN+tasty+StoneX = 89% of April volume
      - ADM Investor Services had some existing accounts that suddenly did big volume around the roll (120, 168, 264);
        interesting to see - jumped out because most other firms had big decrease in volume and they doubled their previous month
  x ah shoot, I forgot the CTI 4 ADV
- LMAO empirical fact about Excel pivot tables: if "Name" is selected, then new column is created, then "Name" is renamed and new column is renamed "Name",
  the pivot table automatically deselects the old column and starts using the new column. that's a bit too much automation for me

- iBoxx Correlations - what do we need to get it ready?
  1) Remember how you set up the gaibo_modules code and the caveats of real-world usage
  2) Add in various other Bloomberg datasets (possibly use local save workflow?)
  3) Bring CDX index code into modern gaibo_modules so we can query that easier than running the script
  - still need to: update CDX code, fix save_fig, refactor IBHY vs. IBIG repeat code

- AMBOX appears to RESET AND RESTART ACCRUING at the beginning of each month to facilitate settlement - it's NOT a usable measure for analysis
  - after reading, AMBOR30 the 30-day rolling average is actually fine as a comparison and should match the 1-month SOFR regardless of compounding technique
    - the only difference between rolling average and multiplication is the daily reinvestment compounding which is small within 1 month
- CME SOFR term rate good, AMBOR30 probably fine enough to satisfy CFTC that this thing is different
- consider fact that term-30 is not 30 days-to-maturity - interesting to see the weighting
- SIFMA's calendar of government securities trading days needed ("days Treasury repo market is open on, which are generally U.S. government securities
  secondary-market trading days as determined by SIFMA")

x immediate: 1) tailor daily CSVs and test export, 2) replace SOFR term rate with SOFR and re-send time series spreadsheet and language
x match with Chodash webpage on small recent discrepancies
x load alternate source and try to match Peter Goldman spreadsheet
x possible sources of error: overnight_ameribor_rate naming
  - yup this ended up being the case - 3 other

. write function for weighted average 30 days

x only safeguard-outlier filter DTCC data, not AFX transactions

x add data ask for Peter Goldman
x SecureShare link for input data

- Peter Goldman response
  - big change in safeguard process: before I kept running 5-day lookback so that we could throw out a different set of transactions each day;
    now, we know each day's "suitable" transactions is filtered and locked in when they occur
    - code should be simplified - no need for traversing 5 days at a time; instead, need a filter start seed (rate prior to first ever date) and then
      rates can be calculated on daily basis and averaged across previous 5 days by weighting
      - must maintain dictionaries for storing 1) relevant previous rates, 2) each date's filtered set,
        3) each date's isolated rate, 4) each date's total DBPV
      - optionally maintain current output of putting 5 days' transactions together, but separately

- 2020-07-03 (July 4th on Saturday) and 2020-04-10 (Good Friday) are only 2 days missing in history of AMBOR30T; don't know why they have values
  - well actually, we are able to produce a value on 2021-04-02 (Good Friday), so may need to reconsider
    x need to be sure to load every single day of data, not just Cboe trade days - change code!
      - yup, reading every file we have instead of trade days fills in numbers for these 2 days! we have no NaNs now
        - however, we are not matching on those 2 days - I reckon their holiday days to maturity handling is not as sophisticated as ours?
  x see if this fixes 2020-07 issue, which is an issue with AFX seemingly not having observed July 3
    - nope - I think it's their holiday days to maturity handling
  x ah, another issue is that I shouldn't be increasing days to maturity for holiday if it's not an "actual" holiday
    - for example, it looks like Good Friday is not observed, though Memorial Day is
      EDIT: Good Friday is NEVER observed (weird, anti-SIFMA), Friday July 3rd is NOT observed (in 2020) though weekday July 4th is
      x correcting for days to maturity increases prior to Good Friday and July 3rd may solve some days' discrepancies
        - yup, good result - note a simpler explanation of this idea is just "we're using every day on which AMERIBOR has data",
          which is simpler than saying we have a calendar with weird bespoke rules

x transactions from 2020-03-26 through 2020-05-26 are off because of 250bp omit would be astute to try calculating those without omitting?
  - yup, calculating without omitting matches Bloomberg exactly. we're right all along
x next issue day is clearly 2019-09-17 - NOT Labor Day (2019-09-02); should test omitting DTCC
  - no, issue is not omitting DTCC because rate was backfilled prior to like mid-March 2021, so no DTCC omitting was necessary before then
  - solved: I omitted 4 transactions, but Bloomberg numbers did not - this affects several other days in history
. next issue is 2019-07-23 - no clue on this one
x next issue is around 2019-04-19 (Good Friday); note that we did have value on Good Friday, so that's a discrepancy inside Bloomberg from 2020!
  - solved with custom calendar NOT observing Good Friday, ever
x September 1 2020 to March 19 2021 for CFTC stats
  x overnight vs. 30-day
    - there were no 30-day ones lol
- CP3 - Core Principles 3 for finger pointing when we get sued; holds us to integrity so we don't give 99% correct numbers to legal filing when
  we know it's wrong and why exactly we're inaccurate

x correct correlations for Dennis
. put 2xJira tickets
. ask Peter about the various trade_ids, various "status" (repaid vs. matured vs. matched)
x add in updated data March-May
x contact Tiago with the updated input data
x let Yoshiki know we're tied up at the moment

o Yoshiki iBoxx Check-In
  . think about what borrow rate represents - see Franz's email that time
  . fully familiarize yourself with code and data
    . reconstruct calculations, figure out the question for Markit
  . figure out the rebalancing methodology questions that need to be asked - why isn't IBXXIBHY holdings a subset of HYG? when are they most off?
  . check back in with Yoshiki after Ameribor Term-30

- people exclusively use TRS to short
- in beginning, people thought CDX would cannibalize TRS but totally not the case

- make future data deliverables have step-by-step calculation guidance; Litch, etc. like to double-check the calculation methodology

- AMBOR30T - using 2021-03-19 to 2021-06-08 replication and AFX prod website intermediates, proved one source of discrepancy is on 2021-04-06 and 2021-04-08
  AFX specifically excluded DTCC data, I assume because it did not arrive on time
  . must ask Peter Goldman how to handle this - DTCC excluded from permanently database? i.e. severe impact to rates for 5 days?
- 100 vs. 10,000 divisor format change had huge impact on large swath of 2017
  - the Marex 2017-03 to 2017-07 only changed 5th decimal
. wait what the hell we actually REGRESSED on 2021-04-02 isolated - at some point we matched exactly and now we don't
  - oh I think it's because at that point I literally didn't read the non-trade date DTCCs; meanwhile I was using Peter's AFX so had all the dates
  . need to ask Peter why we exclude that single line
. AH JEEZ caught a big bug in my code - never accounted for alternate overnight namings! this one's on me
  . ensure all derived fields filled in afx_data!
- I finally understand origin of duplicates in AFX data - our daily folders have overlapping data, e.g.:
  2017-08-21 has 9 transactions from 2017-08-18, 18 from 2017-08-21
  2017-08-18 had the 9 transactions but in an earlier state, i.e. not matured/repaid
  - therefore we should probably drop_duplicates on id (or trade_id, I think both are unique), keep last to get full info on mature/repaid

- OPO migration
  x move and organize desktop stuff
  x [FAILED] update Anaconda and set it up for both Spyder and PyCharm
  . move code somehow - mainly just need the PycharmProjects folder but also the scratch, then need to sync up with upstream
  . test code - run Spyder dailies, change DOWNLOADS_DIR to new OneDrive location
  . test Bloomberg and Bloomberg API!
    x Mike Szela IP whitelisting
    x install API to Office
    . diagnostic having an issue with "authorization"

o Michael in-office meeting
BlackRock was inspiration for scaling HYG up with a factor to 140
Flow and Clear said that was on right path, but fundamentally it's weird
Goldman Freidberg, credit trader assigned for iBoxx, they just left it to him to do pricing (they're struggling to price lol)
Jennifer from BlackRock gave us that info; she is supposed to be helping him
We need to supply Jennifer with the info, though she will pick Andreas Roy from Jane Street's brain
This will be a call next week
Morgan Stanley is also interested in what we find
On top of original use case - extracting implied borrow cost and publishing it, so people can compare TRS vs. futures-implied borrow
Keep in mind Dimitrios's focus may not have had this big picture
Frantz is the Markit guy for data questions
Consider how HYG turns prices into 87 - what's the formula?
OCC risk-based haircuts program - trying to get iBoxx in, can't really do much for raw equities, but maybe for HYG options - much better 5% capital for futures than 50% for HYG
Still trying to hire someone for credit, Arianne wants Jake Glasser from Goldman, apparently he's cross-asset - half credit funds who want to use SPX/VIX for hedging
Remember BSBY - contains credit component, competitor to AMERIBOR; read up on that
Market-making capacity is the argument against Richard Sandor's demand to list infinite things
And Cboe has to pay to incentivize those market-makers
Clearing at LCH would be the ideal, with us listing both AMERIBOR and a SOFR term rate
OCC aren't a player in the interest rate clearing market, that's why we need LCH
Do calendar reminder for Mike Durkin VIXTLT
ProShares: fair value price of VIX tethered to SPX - John Hiatt had some nerd stuff, didn't have time to adjust for convexity; they may revive and ask more at some point
June 6 migration to BOEv3, more deterministic systems
Would affect how many order messages people  send out - check trends on Jump, etc.
First couple days, lower volumes
Complaint that TAS was unfair game, determinism should help? See if we see anything different from that one guy who called twice with systems
Intern stuff - Michael will submit in next week

. VIX up and down days volume analysis

x ask Dennis about Art email - does he already have the data/chart ready? I can just send him March corrected numbers

x okay, so AFX using Federal Reserve System holidays is perfectly fine. I did not know such a system of holidays existed, so I will code that up
x if any white paper edits are agreed upon, make sure they send to Art
x next steps - since we have finalized correct rates, we can finally finish stats for Art
  - supply data vendors with updated rates - Andrew Brown and Peter will lead that
  x talk to Connemara about errors and restatements - who's going to do that?
    x me - coordinate call with Chodash and Dennis next week; invite Andrew and Peter

x VXM Update 2021-05 (as of 24th)
  - VIX index spikes: 27.6 - May 12th (Elon Musk tweets Tesla will no longer accept bitcoin as payment to save the planet)
                      22.2 - May 19th (China bans institutional crypto services)
  - Percentiles
    - VXM volume at 70th percentile - 20,800 (103% rise from 10,241, lowest volume month)
      - customer volume at all time high - ADV 1131 compare to Jan 943
    - OI at 60th percentile - average daily OI of 8570 (24% drop from 11,288, which was by far highest month)
      - 11k to 5k drop at VIX maturity, will rise back up this coming week
      - as we've said before, OI each month is a steady build into the VIX maturity, then huge drop as they convert to big VIX;
  - Account analysis on what's going on with volumes
    - let's start with the existing core vs. new experimenters: we can observe 2 things:
      1) number of new accounts still at level of April - 392 vs. 356
        - recall that back in Jan and Feb we had 1:1 ratio in "existing" accounts vs. "new" accounts; now it's 2:1
      2) both existing and new accounts are doing huge amount more than in April despite same number of accounts active in each category
        - 50% increase in existing accounts output, 126% increase in new account output
        - volume focused around the two VIX spikes, as expected
      - these two point to May being an exciting month for vol trading, yet number of new accounts didn't reflect it like it historically did
        - missed opportunity
        - indeed, big VIX ADV up 40+% as well (103% in VXM)
    - CTI page: observe that CTI 2 vs. CTI 4 volume ratio remained the same
      - MM/customer multiplier relationship held firm - indicates that root is customers
    - Firms page:
      - IB and TD showed increase in new accounts gained matching May vol
      - tasty dropped from 107 April new accounts to 59 May new accounts (missed opportunity)
        - in the past, we've also seen high correlation in IB and TD account increases with market, and weirdly no correlation with tasty
          - ask tasty why this is? does some type of marketing explain this?
      - JP Morgan's 1 singular customer account established November 2020 resumed trading for first time since 2021-01-11 on 2021-05-13 (Tesla bitcoin)
        - several hundred contracts per day! singlehandedly 8% of customer volume despite starting halfway through month
      - IB+TD+tasty+JPM1Account+TradeStation+ADM+StoneX+EDF = 94% of May volume
        - basically last 4 all at around 2-3% share

x VXM Update 2021-06 (as of 21st, big disclaimer)
  - start with recap, since this month is far from done
    - note how year has gone - massive vol in Jan Feb March, super calm April and June sandwiching bitcoin craziness in May
    - takeaway from May: record customer volume - VXM retail customers are at all time high in terms of volume capability,
      but their input depends strictly on whether stuff is happening
      - but there is big asterisk - JPM account
  - VIX index spikes: 20.7 - June 18th (no idea)
    - otherwise lowest/calmest VIX month since April, hovering between 16 and 18
  - Percentiles - yikes
    - VXM ADV at 2nd worst in history after April - 11,130 (down 39% from 18,224 in May which was great vol month)
      - customer ADV hit all time high in May at 1050, June actually sitting at 3rd best in history after May and Jan
        - pleasant surprise - strong customer weak overall is very rare - usually MM-customer ratio is stable; more on that later
      - big VIX ADV is at middle of the road (overall and customer aligned) in past year, so different, probably because of ETPs
    - OI also at 2nd worst - average daily OI of 5965 (down 25% from 7959 in May which was already middle of the road (April by far highest))
      - as we've said before, OI each month is a steady build into the VIX maturity, then huge drop as they convert to big VIX
  - Account analysis on what's going on with volumes
    - let's start with the existing core vs. new experimenters: we can observe 2 things:
      - number of new accounts is hitting record lows - 196 compared to 392 May, 356 April; existing active dropped from 800 to 650
        - ADV contribution of these new accounts is correspondingly halved, while existing holds strong 810 vs. 735
          (compare 513 in weak April)
        - recall that back in Jan and Feb we had 1:1 ratio in "existing" accounts vs. "new" accounts; now it's gone past 2:1
      - takeaway: existing actually trading more than expected in low vol June, but very few new people attracted
    - CTI page: observe that CTI 2 vs. CTI 4 volume ratio changed! 5.8% to 7.6% - customers were resilient while MMs didn't match
      - we haven't seen this in VXM, ever - did incentive program change?
      - despite this, overall ADV still higher than April
    - Firms page:
      - kind of unfair to pick out which firms had drops in new accounts with 7 days remaining
        - mention IB and TD vs. tasty correlation finding from May
      - IB and TD showed increase in new accounts gained matching May vol
      - tasty dropped from 107 April new accounts to 59 May new accounts (missed opportunity)
        - in the past, we've also seen high correlation in IB and TD account increases with market, and weirdly no correlation with tasty
          - ask tasty why this is? does some type of marketing explain this?
      *- JP Morgan's 1 singular customer account established November 2020 resumed trading for first time since 2021-01-11 on 2021-05-13 (Tesla bitcoin)
        - several hundred contracts per day! singlehandedly 8% of customer volume despite starting halfway through month
        - continued every day this month so singlehandedly 15% of June customer volume
      - EDF also had an account doing huge 100-300 contracts a day first 8 days of June!
        - account joined 2021-05-03
      - IB+TD+tasty+JPM1Account+TradeStation+ADM+StoneX+EDF = xx% of June volume
        - basically last 4 all at around 2-3% share

o Litch and Jennifer Schnabl
  - trash bucket - European funds need to diversify, not hold too much of other funds; futures don't count towards "holding other funds"
  - futures excludes the large amount of HYG cash (not technically a holding - Litch had reasoning for this)
  - CT Bloomberg futures contract table
  - EXC can see if you're subscribed to an exchange (level 1 live quotes level 2 order book depth)
  - MDM (market depth monitor) can see order book depth if you have subscribed
    - "Total" is cumulative total when you plow through
  - Litch's simple model is "how much HYG changed" applied to how much futures changed
    - however, futures cash index doesn't exactly represent where futures are trading
  - on the last business day, rebalance (remember settlement is after that rebalance! tricky!)
    - mature against rebalanced index! so trade entire month in anticipation of coming back together with HYG
    - this is why we say HYG is the proper reference for pricing
  - 1300 CUSIPs, value my future based on which are applicable or not
    - but, since fundamentally we are hedging with ETF, isn't that creation basket more relevant? (Morgan Stanley??)
  - futures "cash and carry" - think about how much funding is for person who has to buy it today (even if I don't - I buy in future)
  - equity vs. fixed income futures
    - iShares campaign: ETF vs. futures
      - financing your futures at the bank is way more in equities, so they were saying buy ETF
      - this doesn't hold in fixed income
  - S&P 500 can lend out for 1 or 2 basis points
  - HYG futures land - can lend ETF for 5%, 3%
  - Jennifer next question: premium and discount
    - TRS 3 month swap premium/discount tends towards 0; 50 bps tend towards 0, realize that discount/premium over time
      - like an equity dividend pickup
    - so there are a whole lot of break fees (protects P&L of trade)

x review revised white paper
  - outlier trimming: "delivered at a fixed interest rate within 250 basis points of the previous day’s AMERIBOR® Term-30 rate" great
    - can we include this in appendix example calculation?
  - "on each day that the AFX lending markets are open" good but can we add footnote?
    - oh never mind, page 7 has it! lmao terrible organization
  - footnote 1 is very important, and last sentence doesn't make sense.
    because of the mechanic where additional days are added to the initial 5, there is never a case where $25bn is not reached.
    so what exactly happens when DTCC data (or AFX data I guess) is later than 6:30pm? calculated without that component and then restated
    a few days later? or use previous day's AMBOR30T and restated later?
    also should mention that if data is late one day, it could potentially affect the next 5+ days if data is still missing,
    and all 5+ of those days will have to be restated.
    - In the event that any data component is not received by 6:30 p.m. CST,
      AMERIBOR® Term-30 may be calculated according to its regular methodology with the data present and is deemed valid so
      long as the minimum volume threshold of $25 billion is reached. If the minimum volume threshold is not reached, and
      additional trailing day/days’ worth of data is added to the dataset according to the methodology described above.
      - contradictory
    - In the event that the database of commercial paper and commercial deposit transactions aggregated by the DTCC is unavailable at the normal time of publication for AMERIBOR® Term-30, the previous day’s AMERIBOR® Term-30 rate may be published followed by an accompanying correction notice distributed to data vendors.
      - LMAO they included the footnote for a 3rd time

x respond to internal replication question email

o Markit Catch-up
  - inflation index Frantz to Dennis
  - Frans still working on contract
  - Frans working on John Yang feedback on website
  - wave of inbounding inquiries to iBoxx over past week and a half for unknown reason (marketing looking into it)
    - a lot of people responding to Litch with "yeah sure let's chat"
  - good calls with Jennifer explaining order book, etc. credit background->futures
    - Morgan Stanley chat: Brandon Mazzeo (Frans knows him) credit and a separate product strategy business dev person
      - really interested, had questions about pricing etc., answering his own questions sometimes
      - excited thinking it as exactly equivalent to TRS (different reaction from others)
  - Goldman starting to price (was apparently bad price compared to Virtu) but still calibrating
    - Goldman want to host a webinar aiming for July!

o Chodash call
  - Connamara: AMERIBOR loans, Monday through Thursday weekday loan, then weekend loan
  - Steve would prefer Connamara use maturity date from AFX, not calculate their own calendar
    - we checked and found that my data did not have maturity date filled in; Connamara will have to build their own calendar
  - check for DTCC data on Columbus and Veterans
    - why not calculate? futures would trade
    - Answer: no DTCC data on either of those days
      - https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/Investment-Product-Services/user-documentation/Holiday-Schedule-MF.pdf
        says NO SETTLEMENT on those days! convenient

- okay so exchange holidays and U.S. Federal bank holidays are sort of the 2 categories!
  - exchange is pretty clear
  - bank is Federal Reserve K.8
  - DTCC respects both

- Holidays reasoning:
*New Year's Day - any day of the week - need observance rules!
MLK Day - 3rd Monday of January
Presidents Day - 3rd Monday of February
Good Friday - Friday before Easter Sunday (March or April)
Memorial Day - last Monday of May
*July 4 - any day of the week - need observance rules!
Labor Day - 1st Monday of September
Columbus Day - 2nd Monday of October
*Veterans Day - any day of the week - need observance rules!
Thanksgiving Day - 4th Thursday of November
*Christmas Day - any day of the week - need observance rules!
  - 11 total holidays in a year
    *- 4 floating (could fall on any day of week)
    - 5 Monday
    - 1 Thursday
    - 1 Friday
  - NEVER in June or August; March and April combine for 1 (Good Friday)

- AMBOR90T here we go
  - $10bn threshold (instead of $25bn)
  - 41-120 days to maturity (instead of 1-40)
    - so only DTCC data, no AFX
  - code refactor considerations: configure 1) days to maturity left and right bounds, 2) threshold, 3) take out AMBOR30T mentions
    - that means load all data as a dataset, then apply filters of days to maturity and threshold for 2nd layer dataset
  - to fix DF auto-converting into Series when index selection is a single element, just add [index selection] brackets

- 2021-06 ETF Treasury VIX file issue
  - a new issue has arrisen - _holdings.csv files can come in with literally just one character, clocking in at 1kb file size
  - these should be deleted and re-downloaded
  - issues occurred for as of dates: 2021-06-01, 2021-06-14, 2021-06-24
    - removing the 1kb files and re-downloading fixed everything
  - when issues like this happen and I don't fix it bespoke, OSC appears to copy previous day's file over, which is great
  - some additional dates for which the 1kb holdings filesize happened:
    Fixed by re-downloading: 2021-07-01, 2021-01-13 (HYG)
    Unfixable: 2019-11-08 (LQD), 2017-11-21 (LQD), 2017-11-02 (LQD), 2017-10-09 (HYG, LQD)

. GZAP useful functions cleanup (WIP)
  x universal_tools and mpl_tools move to gaibo_modules
  . piecemeal fix up mpl_graph_tools for use, along with finishing patching data_structures
x move correlation functions out of run_iboxx_correlations (and into new universal_tools?)
  - for some reason, ffill doesn't work out of the box and 2-month has NaNs at the end instead of correlation 0??
  x either way, should write function for cropping both sides AND ffilling center!

x create AMERIBOR term rates debrief memo documenting the process and key takeaways
  - really ended up being a mega document

. really need to dig into difference between June weak volume and first 2 months of May (strong volume)
  - compare the customers - is it the same guys, doing less volume? or less guys?
  - "people unwilling to short"?
  - try to take a look at ETPs
    - UVXY assets at $835MM, half of what it was earlier this year
    - VXX around $1bn
    - 10,000 contracts roll + risk recycle accounts for so much
  - VIX contango, so people want to be short (spot-first month, spot second-month, spot third-month, etc. all used as heuristics)
    - the more the spread, the more people want to be short
    - track when exactly term structure changed
    - for the level of SPX, VIX post-COVID lows (spot/3rd month future); compare to 2017 (0.77)
      - Commitment of Traders - people NOT willing to short vol (CVXFTNCS)
        - hedge funds opportunistic - piled in after meme stocks spike, hung around, now not in there?
  - Fed effect?
    - in off months, they release the committee meeting notes
    - "dot plot" - what they think rates will be in next couple of years
    - people positioning in VIX in response to inflation, but Fed says they can't see rates being raised immediately, so inflation trades subsided
    - eventually want bond vs. equity effects/interaction; think about 60-40 traditional investment and how it's affected
    - imagine CPI 3.8 instead of 1.2, equity sell off, vol goes up; if you're short vol because of contango, you might get screwed
  - in 2017 you would short vol to pick up yield, maybe in 2021 you don't do that anymore
  - Pierre de Sable from Dominicci - ran equity derivs at UBS, been around forever: investors attracted to huge returns with high risk right now
    - lots of easy alternatives right now, like Reddit stocks and crypto
  - conclusion: people just don't want to short right now (prevailing sense), but here are the exact numbers supporting that
  - 2021-06-06 change to deterministic trading system! we're going to get a lot of questions on whether this had an effect
    - not gonna affect customers - they come in through fixed connection
    - but Eagle7, Jump
    - used to address issues in TAS, but who knows how else it was being systematically exploited (could have bigger effect)
    - if we look at number of orders sent, etc. maybe we could see some patterns
    - "can we get daily order counts for these 5 firms" to Charlie or Thedinger
    - it really shouldn't be harming volume, but we should still track
  - implied vs. realized vol would be nice

- VIX percentiles
  - 2021-06-18 was actually a 92% volume day in past year; matched with spike up to 20.7 between high 17s in VIX
    - Fed indicated it could increase rates sooner than expected; inflation worries; lowest SPX dip since late Feb
      - Stock Market News for Jun 21, 2021 - Yahoo Finance is a great resource (from Zacks)
  - 2021-06 at 169,846 ADV was actually median of past 12 months (2020-05 to 2020-12 was all right around 150,000, then with 2021-01 we had GME)
    - down 31% from 2021-05's 245,020, but comparable to 2021-04's 186,216 since April was also very low VIX
  - 2021-06 at average daily OI 338,551 has been stable since 2021-02, slightly above median of past 12 months
- Commitment of Traders: trends within OI
  - speculative VIX shorts half of level prior to COVID (100k contracts less) - lack of appetite despite strong contango
    - narrative: lots of high return bull market alternatives such as crypto right now compared to VIX during quiet times
  - biggest difference since 2017 is leveraged money short VIX has halved (with Feb-5 and COVID)
    - open interest has more or less followed suit
  - more recently, asset managers' appetite for short VIX was high in 2019 but halved with COVID and has only recovered halfway
    - slightly increased appetite for long VIX, balanced by recent increased leveraged money short
  - dealer and leveraged money long VIX positions decreased with COVID and haven't recovered
- Spot-3rd month VIX ratio
  - pretty stable steep contango since February (3rd month 20-30% above spot)
    - with 2.5 spike exceptions to flatten term structure - 1) beginning of March Treasury selloff, 2) mid-May crypto craziness, 3) mid-June hawkish Fed
  - it doesn't really get steeper than this (not in the past 3 years)
- VIX implied vol way higher than SPX realized (historic ratio) due to sector rotations
- Firms
  - CTI 2 comparable to April; CTI 4 had more active accounts than April but much less size per account (611 vs. 715)
  - Morgan Stanley, SocGen, Goldman, JP Morgan, Citi: CTI 4 had less trading per account than April
  - Barclays, Credit Suisse, BAML: CTI 4 comparable to April

o Fubon call
  - Sharon Ang introducing us to Anson (exchange-traded products issued by Fubon) and Jenny (ETF team, Hong Kong, Taiwan, futures)
  - Anson (in Chinese): want to hear of recent developments of US vol ETFs
  - TVIX delisted, SVIXY delevered; VolatilityShares trying to get approval
  - Michael proposes TAS sessions for Asian hours (e.g. Taipei close time) if it would help ETPs in Asia
  - Anson: Taiwan SEC against product, they're trying; retail investors increasingly interested, but ; 2) past couple years, good development, but then crude oil thing happened last year and wrecked ETPs and Taiwan SEC became very conservative
    want to ask US experts - how did you solve these regulatory issues? what direction do we try to convince Taiwan SEC
  - Michael: there are benefits to the products of hedging portfolios, expressing opinions, etc.; we should get Taiwan SEC in touch with US SEC;
    ETP issuers did bulk of work convincing regulators, our guidance is anecdotal
  - John: do Taiwan regulators have access to institutional (ji1 gou4 tou zi zhe) vs. customer (san3 hu4) numbers in the US? can they communicate with US regulators to understand that
    in US the suitability is very much geared towards institutional
    - for instance, ETNs had different suitability from ETFs

- Recall that for Leks Gerlak at ProShares, around end of May, I delved into the liquidity sources, exported the data from a
  very temporary dashboard, and then imported it into Excel for a pivot table
  - this had a lot of potential, but it was cut short for iBoxx and Ameribor Term-30
. Consider that our VIX individual customer/MM analysis is now weak spot - need that heatmap code ready for re-use!
  - percentiles covers general volume/OI/notional/customer context
    - further breaking down 1) customer, we have the VXM/iBoxx track_distinct_accounts, which is VERY unwieldy with big VIX data
    - further breaking down 2) ETPs, we have the code from mid-April
  - another thing to consider regularly is CFTC Commitment of Traders
  - Michael is always good for industry reads - quotes on general vol market trends, e.g. no one wants to short right now
  - liquidity: bid/ask sizes have never recovered post-COVID - why is that?
  . Commitment of Traders dashboard needs to be updated and understood!

- Parallax Master Fund has clearly been misclassifying its CTIs - was giving 200,000 CTI 4 contracts in April and May, 24k in June,
  but switched rest to CTI 2

. mention Sarah Cummings email didn't go through

o Michael discussing Arianne results
  - 3rd month ratio - incorporate 2017, include VIX number for reference
  - in 2017, no fear that Fed would raise rates (Fed "put"; they would swoop in), and no big movement in SPX, so short vol heaven
  - can we use VIXTLT or something to show we're in a different place than we were in 2017, 2018? that has to be a factor to explain why we aren't
    shorting vol
    - questions: what's different?
  - want to look at number of orders for Jump after determinism

. challenge: overall correlation for iBoxx
  - idea: 2019-07 to present, splitting at 2020-02-24
    - do some variations on 2019-07 - try 2019-03
  - have a separate spreadsheet containing just a few correlation numbers:
    1) full history
    2) 2019-03 to present
    3) 2019-07 to present
    4) 2019-03 to 2020-02-24
    5) 2019-07 to 2020-02-24
    6) 2020-02-24 to present
  - consider what if we don't want "present" but a slightly-early cutoff

o Kathy Nguyen marketing initiatives
  - paid pageviews vs. non-paid pageviews
  - CTAs - LinkedIn (21% spend), Demandbase (list of account names, system identifies IP addresses)
  - buy side - The Trade, Seeking Alpha (16% spend, but intent seems low)
  - top pieces - contract specs, vendor quotes (not too much content); people don't engage with backsheet as much
    - can try to lead users through a journey - blog, etc.
  - publications - Credit FLUX (credit traders), FI Desk (buy side), Traders Magazine (buy side), Risk.net (buy side)
    - our issue is we don't have an "in" with credit traders, so Credit FLUX interesting
    - Michael: let's focus on first 2
  - Bloomberg competitor ticker ads - very expensive, but makes a lot of sense; we need some interesting pieces though, not just a spec
    - Michael: for instance, YAS screen would have been great for iBoxx, but probably no chance; also launchpad screen
  - CME SmartBrief Dedicated Send (owns a bunch of newsletters)
    - consider email with spec just showing instead of clicking
    - series of sends is great
  - budget: $45k a month for 6 months, so total $270k
  - big issue: we need content; we could get Markit to generate content? BlackRock as well, but unrealistic
    - so blog would be tough
    - Kathy: Credit FLUX could actually have experts write timely content for us? sounds too easy to be true...
  - storyline from Litch webinars would be a good one to just write down (can we make the slides like this?)
    - we have an editorial department now?
  . what's the reach of Credit FLUX? how do we measure that
    - Frans Scheepers knows the guys, so seems legit; but in recent years they just talk about CLNs, does not reach CLOs
      - Global Capital is Frans's rec for FI world
      - Risk.net everyone reads as well
    - all 4 from Kathy are from convo with Tim (idk who that is)
  - top performing keywords for QE volume: "vanguard high yield bond fund" lol
    - we can tell them to focus on "high yield" or something

. figure out preliminary data questions for Markit by call tomorrow?

o Term-90 draft spec
  - AMT3 is futures symbol name
  - AMT3M and AMT3R are the same at settlement day
  - AMT3S is 1-AMT3R
  - AMT3R is 4pm, but everything else is 6pm? but they should be the same number

o Sarbanes-Oxley
  - testing of key controls; this is for fees - want to make sure fee changes went through appropriately
  - previously saw deficiencies
    - need evidence that we did check??
  - Jennifer Gillund - P drive markets division pricing is what these guys (Tanalee, Mike Werling, Evan Marcano) need access to
    - JG is apparently verifying BZX options, etc.
  - I deadass cannot understand a single thing they're saying; what is "requested support"?
o Michael response
  - equities makes change every month, there were some questions on verifying their process
    - Thomas Mueller would make some mistakes I think
  - options fee schedule is like 14 pages long and futures is 1.5
  - futures generally changes once a year, calendar year
    - reason is FCMs price what they'll do, like quote $2 or something, and they would be screwed on their quote if we change fees during year
    - Arianne and Ed come from options and want to do it more often, but that would be annoying to FCMs
  - in August we'll evaluate futures changes
  - back in March we had Arianne meeting, changing incentives for mini VIX, that'll take place in August 1
  . inbound for pricing changes should be literally us deciding changes (rare), outbound though?
    . reach out to the regulator guys

x talk to Kathy
. talk to Annapurna once you write down dashboard stuff and sort out questions from old dashboards
x send old iBoxx slides to Hemal
x check OPO PC Bloomberg after 4pm

o Litch Yayati
  - liquidity not an issue because tied to ETF which has daily 2bn, though through order book you can only do like 50MM
  - physically-backed ETF - 100MM ETF backed by 100MM bonds
  - premium/discount on NAV is where illiquidity of underlying comes in
    - the NAV is not broken
  - ETF is "homogenized block of beta"
  - note futures settle on NAV, not premium/discount
  - two-way possibilities are good
  - pension fund ALS - use CDS options to hedge, but LQD would be better match
  - huge pool of money that can't transact right now because of regulations
  - high net worth individuals want dividends, but our total return doesn't provide that; ETF + futures you can probably get to it
  - Carl Freiberg from Goldman is the guy to phone for block?

. vol regimes! start trying to use those

- consider that 2021-06 was an IBHY monthly volume sum record; same volume as May but 2 more trading days
  - same contracts moving around from settle to settle (roll accounting for virtually everything?), but ADV is artificially a lot different because # days
  - so it may actually be worth it to track monthly volume sum as opposed to just ADV

- IB in VXM - Arianne says high volume, I don't think so
  . would be useful to have average size per trade! and number of trades I suppose

- XR vs. Wolverine
  - problem could be market data lag
  . consider how much of the book depth Wolverine provides - if they leave how many times in history would we have been screwed?

o Data Group Meeting
  - Jupyter functionality tutorial (analytics layer)
  - postgres stored on server instead of locally - awesome
    - server 56 petabytes RAM lol
  - all using server resources too! local machine limitations can be avoided
  - Q: external libraries? A: goal over time is to have all Python libraries pulled in, reach out via email to Andrew Paulman
    - uh oh, not great for gzap
  - still beta testing, still Eileen's group only for a couple months
  - personal responsibility for not making your personal database too large lol
    - you can see other people's databases! but you can't edit them
  - postgres (playground) vs. hadoop (data platform)
  - can export to local CSV!
  - todo: automated scheduler!
  - data will be available in Tableau! can load postgres directly into Tableau, but still need to whitelist desktop IP addresses
  - 391 tables in DP now btw

- Charlie queueing TAS book - ask Michael what it means

- Eris centrally cleared interest swaps went to CME, they rebranded as a crypto exchange, started own derivatives clearing org (DCO)
  - we owned from legacy ownership part of the new ErisX
  - Deters bought ErisX as our re-entrance into crypto

o Kaitlyn Meyer
  - I work with Michael Mollet in CFE, in Futures
  - ask about Jenn Fortino
  . add "last active" date for each account/row to new_accounts Python code
  . add for each account a "months active" checkbox - will have to be independent of existing table I think!
  . construct sheet with 1) "last active"-based judgment on revival, 2) "months active"-based judgment on momentum
  . "months active" can get its own sheet for deep dive into specific accounts to visualize when they're active! with number of trades per day/month

. Steve Laipply: discount the duration "forward duration" - ask Yoshiki if methodology is obvious
. message Krista to revive question of who decides files to send

- iBoxx files notes
  - portfolio duration vs. duration - it accounts for ex-dividend dates and "coupon adjustments"
  - capped market value is what you use to weight
  - AMC has a PIK factor! 2021-07-12 row 350
  - Transocean Sentry from Cayman Islands has Redemption factor row 261
  - Navistar (x2 bonds apparently), Videotron, Tempo, and Mattel have 0 PIK and Redemption somehow (instead of 1). not sure what this means
  . what exactly is "annualized" and how is it different? (yield "based on compounding period of a year")
  . why can't I match "nominal value" (https://www.markit.com/TradableiBoxxIndices and in "indices") to simple sum of "notional"?
    - it appears both stay constant through month, so why don't they match?
  - rebalance of IBXXIBHY is month-end last BUS DAY; keep in mind futures settle on first of month, so price settles on post-rebalance portfolio
  - IBOXHY (HYG benchmark) is market-value weighted but issuer capped at 3%
    - "all Markit iBoxx indices are rebalanced monthly on the last business day of the month after the close of business,
       eliminating the need to roll the index"
  - "indices": daily, 1 row summary (compares to pure base, shows total return for index number)
  - "underlyings": daily, daily master (allows breakdown of "indices" numbers except for "Nominal Value")
  - "components": monthly, monthly master (post-rebalance, pre-next-month; the pure base holdings!)
  . 2021-05-03 suddenly files are corrupt: "UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 17: invalid start byte"
    - bad 3 continuous weeks + 2 days - 2021-05-03 to 2021-05-25 - fixed on 5/26!
  . 2019-12-02, etc. incorrect methodology on certain beginnings of month!
  . 2019-12-11 and 2019-12-12 incorrect methodology in middle of month - what gives?
- iBoxx white paper notes:
----
- note IBXXIBHY is overlap of HYG and iBoxx USD High Yield Developed markets Index (broader version of Liquid High Yield Index) weighted
  by NOTIONAL amounts in HYG portfolio subject to constraints to keep composition within risk parameter boundaries of Liquid High Yield
- only HYG holdings received at the close of the last business day of the month will be considered in re-balancing (not sure if that matters)
*- new bonds issued are taken into account if
  1) publically known to settle until the last calendar day of month inclusive
  2) rating and amount outstanding has become known at least 3 trading days before the end of the month
- 3 preview lists are published 10, 5, and 3 trading days before end of the month (wow!)
- on last business day of month, constituents of index are determined; the new membership becomes effective and is published on 1st bus day of next m
- if HYG includes RegS securities, IBXXIBHY will include equivalent 144A bond (assuming bond is in HY developed markets index)
- Liquid High Yield Index and IBXXIBHY weight difference for each rating bucket (BB, B, CCC, CC, C) should not exceed 5%
  - each sector weight diff <= 5%
  - average duration diff <= 1 year
  - average yield diff <= 1%
  - IBXXIBHY should contain >= 50% of Liquid High Yield holdings
  - bonds not in Liquid High Yield <= 5% of IBXXIBHY (WAIT WHAT? HOW CAN THERE BE ANY IN THE FIRST PLACE? A: it's Liquid HY not Developed)
- if bond is redeemed intra-month, it ceases to exist
- cash from coupons and redemptions is held as cash in index and reinvested into index at rebalance
- index starts 2013-01-31 with 100
- assumption: T+0 settlement days for iBoxx indices calculations (!!!)

. respond to Angelos modified duration thing after figuring out calculation for option-adjusted effective duration
  - effective duration is basically empirical - get the tangent from estimating derivative lol
  - option-adjusted effective duration seems more technical - account for probability of call date becoming the new maturity date if issuer exercises
    - haven't found a formula though - can we obtain it through reasoning?
  - my understanding is that if to worst duration is like 1.5 and to maturity duration is like 5, then effective is just slightly above 1.5
  - either way, iBoxx needs effective duration
- Fabozzi: duration x means "price sensitivity to rate changes of an x-year zero-coupon bond"; don't think of it as years, but as sensitivity to vol
- consider that the portfolio duration by weighted average has critical assumption that correlation between all yield changes is 1
  - alternative to weighted average: get dollar change from yield change and divide by initial total market value to get % price change from yield change
- modified vs. effective duration/convexity: modified assumes yield change doesn't affect cash flows, while effective is better
  - Fabozzi is clear in this simple conceptual difference
x read iBoxx promo slide
x read iBoxx white paper (gulp)
x respond to Yoshiki email
. go over code
  . commence using code to find portfolio differences (to continue exploring iBoxx SFTP files)
. send Markit (Frantz) email asking about issues (also ask about why effective duration isn't included on website), ask about callable bond call price

o Physical Port Min Fee Update
  - Wolverine wants lower number switch ports as they believe they're faster, wanted 29
    - we gave them 20 new ones already
  - proposed: 3 months fee for physical cross-connect
    - it is currently 1 month fee
  - what is layer 1? why are they saying there's a long-term solution there?
    - new hardware service: bypass intermediate layers to deliver market data to customer to shave off time (what is "jitter"?)
    - "Market Data Bypass Phase 1"
  - this low port number discrepancy is supposedly very small - maybe it's the reason Wolverine are losing, maybe not
  - is determinism actually good? for someone to always lose?
  - changed the game: pushing regulatory boundaries for arbitrage (warming ports lmao) to pure speed
    - the next game has begun: ordering low ports; this is why we need to discourage with high fees
    - switches not coming until October (currently 2021-07-14)
      - 10 switches needed for this Phase 1 Bypass apparently including Nexus switches (1gig, fundamentally those guys don't care about speed)
        - 6 more, for between the NY4 and NY5 (what does that mean lmao)
      - all you can do with the simple switches is just replicate on different ports; no filtering, multicast joins, etc. (MPGA? some modern tech)
  - apparently XR came to us a couple months ago and asked about buying specific switch numbers, so they're also doing it, along with some others
  - "L1" switches - we could literally randomize switches if that's actually gets us out of the port game

- US daylight savings time is
  March 2nd Sunday - November 1st Sunday (local time, Spring 2am to 3am, Fall 2am to 1am, 34 weeks)
  British summer time is
  March last Sunday - October last Sunday

- Yoshiki call prep
  - I have thoroughly studied Dimitrios's code and the 3 types of Markit files that we get via FTP
    - I think I have a grasp on how the rebalancing works, checked it out with numbers short of literally doing HYG vs. developed high yield index
  - solved Dimitrios Base Market Value question - need to use separate "components" FTP file that contains rebalance info
    - e.g. end of month 6/30 prices but with post-6/30-close-i.e.-7/1 holdings; using either 6/30 or 7/1 "underlyings" files is literally not enough
  . small hiccup there right now: I should be able to just do level_today = level_rebalance*(MV_today+CPV_today)/BMV_rebalance but it's not quite
    - should be something minor like redemption cash or payment in kind being reinvested into index? not sure yet
  . after that, I want to do close study of daily holdings differences between HYG and IBXXIBHY to see if there are illegitimate patterns
    . we were seeing holdings in IBXXIBHY that were not in HYG, which shouldn't be the case, so should figure that out (I have some theories)
      - could be 144A equivalent in IBXXIBHY which represents RegS securities in HYG?
  . 3 preview lists are published 10, 5, and 3 trading days before end of the month; if we want fair value, need those imported in code for sure
  - to me it seems like an elimination game - remove no-chance securities from HYG holdings and use remaining in the formula above
    - the 3 preview lists are like glances at the official correct answer, but only kick in 10 days from the end of month
  - after that, I'm having trouble picturing how to get info for in-HYG-but-not-in-IBXXIBHY-yet holdings (seems really hard):
    - need to figure out capping for market value, need to figure out cash (coupons); (can ask Markit guys)
  - it's my understanding that the borrow rate piece doesn't even come in until we start churning out a "fair value" number based on HYG holdings
  . restart convo with Frantz on details of the files
    - capping (wait, what are the capped fields? what is capping factor? does HYG/LQD also cap similarly), some fields, duration, location of 3 preview lists a month
  . restarting conversation with Krista Lynch from BlackRock to see if the holdings files contain the appropriate HYG holdings info
  . Steve Laipply: discount the duration "forward duration" - ask Yoshiki if methodology is obvious

x verify that futures track HYG more than IBXXIBHY
- we need to concretely get to within bid and ask
- we THINK index is not the proper underlying; when we used it with Markit/Hanweck borrow, couldn't get close to market
  - ask Markit how they come up with composite
- two ideas: 1) HYG level info, caveat settle is to index, not HYG
             2) holdings-level info

o Jennifer iBoxx
  - VIXTLT: Paul McGeough and Jennifer are pushing for IBOR/ABOR changes in the files
    - want timeline from us - our response as always is we are ready lol
  - good call with Morgan Stanley - their current iBoxx TRS guy was excited, but they need a new internal approval which is hell
    - an American state public pension was asking about the IG iBoxx futures! - Meredith
  - JP Morgan appears to release new products a lot? but they are brick wall
    - Emerick Payet, Theo longlastname
  - guy from Goldman? (Litch referenced them doing 1 trade against Union then nothing else) thinks street price is too rich (high)

o Michael
  . VVIX/VIX ratio is something SIG is tracking
  . review TLT stuff - Krista files, Paul McGeough description
    . what exactly was the step forward?
    . why can't we use the night email file??
    . what is the daily Spyder code used for again?
  . IBHY futures vs. HYG - divergence happened around 2020-12, so start from then and look at when returns became weird
    - they got worse obviously right around 2021-04, massively bad late 2021-06
    - potential theory: the high correlation period is actually sus - maybe help desk was manually correcting to HYG returns
  . send Frantz email about preview lists etc.
  . when going through holdings comparisons, check market value vs. capped market value vs. HYG holdings percentages

. try regression on returns? rather than scaling ratio
  - rolling 6 month basis, use that beta as multiplier
  - correlation is in returns, so that makes sense
*- issues:
  - goal: instead of scaling up HYG with rolling scaling ratio, run rolling regression on HYG returns vs. iBoxx returns
  - but it can't be HYG vs. IBXXIBHY returns, because they don't correlate in the first place
  - issue with HYG returns vs. IBHY1 returns: regression should give optimal coefficient to align the returns, but our result looks like an HYG clone
- note: Dimitrios's use of HYG Expense Ratio made NO SENSE lol
  - wait, do we even need to use that? isn't it already assumed in NAV lol
. what if there's a constant in the regression? could it represent the disjoint of HYG vs. iBoxx?

- Treasury bonds is Actual/Actual but corporate/muni/agency securities are 30/360
- accrued interest: buyer must compensate seller for portion of coupon that seller earned
  - it's a simple proportion of coupon
  - in US, always quote clean price but pay dirty price; elsewhere, they can quote dirty price
- consider income from reinvestment of the coupon interest payments (interest-on-interest)
- current yield, yield-to-maturity, yield-to-call, yield-to-worst
  - current yield is the stupidest thing possible literally dollars of coupon a year/market price
  - YTM considers interest-on-interest but assumes interest can be reinvested at the YTM! (that's what the constant discounting formula implies!)
    - reinvestment risk is when you can't invest interest at a rate as high as the anticipated YTM
      - note zero-coupon bonds have NO reinvestment risk; on the flip side, huge coupons means huge reinvestment risk
      - longer the maturity, the more reinvestment risk as well
    - interest rate risk is when you sell bond early at a price loss and miss out on the anticipated YTM
- "periodic interest rate" is a good name for BEY_semiannual/2; note that 2*semiannual rate gets you the bond-equivalent yield, but the
  proper effective annual yield is (1+semiannual)^2 - 1, generalize to (1+periodic_rate)^k - 1 where k is # payments a year
- yield = "internal rate of return"
- wait so how the hell can you have "modified duration to worst" lmao
  - by definition MD assumes cash flows stay the same when yield changes
  - we can get yield-to-worst, but that comes with a very specific set of cash flows... is that the MD to worst?
- finaly conclusion: effective duration is very different from modified duration to worst!
  - effective duration is empirically measured from
    (price when yield slightly down like 10bp - price when yield slightly up like 10bp)/2/initial price/change in yield
    using valuation models I guess. would need to model option-free bond price and subtract option price I think
    - includes consideration of "chance" of call happening at this very moment
  - MD to worst is MD assuming call happens on date of worst yield
  - both describe % price change with change in yield, but effective duration is here-and-now-all-things-considered and MD to worst is very
    specific worst-yield-scenario

x see if I can just make my code evaluate Ameribor 250bp trimming validity
x Debbie Koopman

- SPIKES Miax is apparently paying $500k a month for people to trade 1000 ADV

- Scott Elias (guy for Taze (?)) found future lagged HYG, but recently futures outperforms HYG
x make Historical Daily Lookup dashboard have way to check restatements
  - it's literally just use Calculation Method = 'D' (see Albert's email)

o VIXTLT Refresh
----
- issue on VIXTLT holdings files as described by Paul McGeough:
  - iShares and Aladdin are separate entities at BlackRock; data lives in iShares as proprietary
  - we want immediately-after-close share info (IBOR), which is not "public"
  - Aladdin gets the risk of the portfolio live (IBOR), but not the share info (ABOR)
- IBOR vs. ABOR
  - IBOR is risk of fund (faster)
  - ABOR is what's settled
  - if create/redeem is done tonight, investment book (IBOR) accounts for those bonds, but accounting book (ABOR) doesn't record
    until money settles which is T+2

- code:
Base TYVIX
  - pull_treasurydirect_notesbonds_universe
  - create_delivery_baskets
  - derive_options_futures_schedule
  - convert_osaka_format (for loading delivery basket (CTD candidates) notes/bonds, Treasury futures, ETF holdings into DICE)
    - retconned into having VIXTLT stuff
Intraday TYVIX (sending to DICE every hour)
  - bloomberg_data_snapshots_v2
  - generate_current_CTD_MD
VIXTLT
  - scrape_ishares_csv (VIXTLT)
  - create_cashflows_dice (pulled by Tiago's DICE code for intraday basis point VIXTLT)

- updated shares number->correct implied cash->correct cashflows->correct MD->correct basis point VIXTLT

- outstanding code correction: I was neglecting settlement time

next steps: once FTP is set up, have them send holdings+IBOR thing, I can fix code, send to Brian Eck's group for production version
Krista Lynch: ask what files are available for sending through FTP ("tonight's email" vs. holdings file with outdated shares)
Paul McGeough will fix the BlackRock-distributed cashflows files accordingly
we will change to do "forward duration" (discount the duration)
----

. remember to check SPIKES TAS volume increase date against the ProShares TAS study
- July 9th is next call with Steve Laipply - contact McGeough and Krista before then
- real time TLT prices is all we need for historical real time basis point VIXTLT
. AMERIBOR fallback provision - not in my code yet
  - figure out what it is
  - basically use spread to EFFR, but rolling average (up for debate how long the roll is)

. resume iBoxx fair value broken code - even with correct BMV we're not getting the right numbers sometimes

- Bloomberg COMP good returns comparison tool
- think about tracking not necessarily to index, but to the other instrument you can use
. add JNK to iBoxx correlations

- iBoxx CFEVOLOI vs. Data Platform (my settlement unified data table)
  - perfect match except 1) CFEVOLOI includes half-days (Christmas Eve, Thanksgiving Friday, July 3, Bush Sr. Day of Mourning):
    2019-12-24, 2019-11-29, 2019-07-03, 2018-12-24, 2018-12-05, 2018-11-23
    and 2) Data Platform has missing 2018-09-10 (IBHY) and 2018-10-08 (IBIG) to 2018-11-08 chunk!
    - note that in 2020 and 2021 we no longer have these issues; could be a dataset problem with Settlement+OI; CFE Order Fill may have those missing half-days
  - as it is, it's best to combine both sources!

x OKAY ANNOYING BUG IN Historical Daily Lookup! when you switch to add Weeklys, the Futures Term doesn't automatically go "all" - you have to select it!
  - fiddling with the defaults in Tableau desktop and republishing fixes it
  - the issue did not affect my very first run of create_percentile_ranks on 2021-04-30 - it arose when I made edits to the dashboard in May
x update create_percentile_ranks to handle Ameribor futures as well

. straight up remove the trash "correction" iBoxx dates like IBIG 2020-07-14 now that we know they are unnatural yet not "fixable"

. rule for sorting out Weeklys in Historical Daily Lookup - it's just for VIX and AMW, so split string by '/' character and then in first half skip to end of name
  - e.g. AMW3/Q1 -> 3 is number therefore it is "weekly" (though in case of 7-day Ameribor that is weird to say)
         VX31/Q1 -> 31 is number therefore it is "weekly"

x AMERIBOR Term-30 2 things by Tuesday
  1) 250bp vs. the others
  2) EFFR 5-year window

x continue going through spreadsheet
- think about workflow for putting together reports - you get the base numbers but then you gotta make sure it's not just 1 person's activity
  making you generalize behavior to market (check 1) new guys and check 2) for single person doing huge activity)

- VIX July CTI 4 volumes observations
Barclays 20%
JPM 10.8%
Morgan Stanley 9.6%
Goldman 9.6%
-- ~50% --
BofA 8.9%
Credit Suisse 6.2%
SocGen 5.7%
Citi 5.2%
IB 4.5%
Deutsche 4%
EDF 3.2%
RJO 3%
-- ~90 % --
UBS 2.2%

- lmao Litch had opposite result to you - iBoxx has highest ever number of customers! and on final day there was 200 more roll, changing number
  from 1000 to 1200. was a mistake to exclude last day for sure

- Ameribor EFFR rate question details
  - AFX+DTCC data lookback limit? 10?
  - default EFFR lookback? check 5-year down to 1-month

. respond to Yoshiki and Annapurna ASAP before starting Ameribor and Board Report

o Board Report 2021-08
  - number of people trading - Ed really interested in this
    - "is VIX dead?" "is it a dying product?"
      - Michael: it's diminishing but still getting plenty of use, just not the same way as before
    - "seasoning" info - let's run some analysis on which Quarter the accounts trading were generally created
      - need to know this for Barclays, JPM, etc. accounts; Michael thinks they are people who haven't really left
      - go into individual account, think about summarizing to show how long they've been around, when they last traded, volume share,
        how many days in the month they traded... list them by "tiers" in the summary so we know which accounts are IMPORTANT
        - and then one more level: historically how much each individual account did
        - may need to split Firm page off into its own thing so we can list most important accounts for each firm
          - oh jeez, will need to split several ways! by volume tier, by age tier, by activity tier
          - account level history would be too much, maybe eventually; definitely make firm level historical comparison though!
            - so 1) Firm accounts tier list rows are accounts, 2) Firm proportions (also note proportion of total VIX volume) rows are months
              - if in doubt, start with volume share for importance, age for tiers
----
*- Project Spec
Question to answer:
Qualitatively, who is trading VIX (or any other product) right now? How does that compare to who has traded VIX historically?
  1. Right now, what are the most important (many ways to look at it) accounts trading through each firm?
    1) What's their share of total volume? (Amongst firm and amongst total)
    2) How long have they been around? (Ideally since account creation/first known trade, so as far back in history as we can track)
    3) With what regularity do they trade? (When did they last trade, maybe prior to this month/quarter/year?
                                            When they do trade, how many days a month/quarter/year? How much size per trade, per day?)
    - Tiers on 1) Volume, 2) Age, 3) Activity to know which accounts stand out
  2. How does current activity of these important firms (ideally also accounts, but may be too much info) compare to what they've done historically?
    - The information we want would be as if 1. was run at various times in the past.
      Maybe that is the best solution, maybe there is better way to compress that info.
      Track firm-level activity through history? Show top 20 accounts at given time? Track current top 20 accounts through history? etc.

Example questions that can be answered:
  - How much of our volume is coming from old guard?
  - 5600 accounts in 2020-03, 3000 in 2020-04 - same accounts or different? Who dropped out?

Example formatting:
- For configurable as-of date/month/etc.:
  - For each of CTI 2 and CTI 4 separately (though be able to manually account for misclassifications if desired, e.g. Parallax in 2021-04 and 2021-05):
    - For each firm, sorted by importance (share of total volume, probably):
      - Show rows of accounts, columns being various measures and aggregations (monthly, quarterly, etc.) of volume, age, regularity in last month/quarter/year, etc.
        - Rank accounts so can quickly see who to look at
        - Maybe just copy 3 times, different sorting each time
----

x do Ameribor and VIX ETPs today

- note that Ameribor official rates do not seem to currently include the EFFR thing for 11+ days lol
  - for term 30, only applies to 2 days in history - the very first days 2016-06-01 and 02 on which there were +13 (18) and +7 (12) days!
  - for term 90, applies to 8 days - 2020-03-18 to 2020-03-27
- okay so immediately it's obvious that 5 years EFFR-Term30/Term90 lookback doesn't make any sense - there was no Term90 rate in 2015-03
- note it is actually non-trivial to specify "5 years spread lookback" because how to define years? easiest and best methodology is set number of days
  for rolling - that way it's not a variable how stable the average is
  - ALSO, even more convoluted: how to account for calendar difference between Ameribor and EFFR? I am partial to taking superset of both and
    forward-filling, but alternative is to take subset of days for which both rates exist
- need function for counting days between 2 dates? no, we have functions for shifting 6 months, etc. and function for counting days

x in morning, run code for Term 30
x lay out chart of different rolling lookbacks for spread - 3 years, 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, 1 month
. make eliminated transactions bucket
  . why are they making 5bp drop difference?

- iBoxx summary - definitely note # active accounts - a lot of guys waiting on the sidelines, just not currently doing the volume
  - takeaways from this Arianne newsletter: 1) wait until last day weekend to run iBoxx for accuracy, 2) note active accounts - it's just 30ish
- iBoxx in mid-July had some algorithmic trading issue where Clear's algo lost the lower bound and increased spread width to $12
  - afterwards, Danny Jisa talked to them and asked them to keep a lower bound, and since then they've been trading tons with Mercury (from India)
    - neither Clear nor Mercury use HYG for pricing - Mercury uses Treasuries
- Archigo or something $25bn blow up in July, probably caused Credit Suisse VIX volume drop, and it probably went to the big 4's increase

*. why on earth is Ameribor fallback 5-year average spread over EFFR?
  - if the point is to get the stability of EFFR, why don't we just take a 1-day spread and use that to bring level of EFFR to Term Ameribor?
    - that way, we avoid the inevitable lag-spike caused by the lookback of the rolling average
  - even better, why not just eliminate the fallback? how is it better to use a fallback that involves looking back super far instead of just looking
    super far for the requisite volume threshold?
    - well, Fed Board of Governors says we need a robust fallback rate, so we have to have something, at least on paper
  - also, we can extend the day limit from 10 to 15 and avoid having it activate for Term 90 in 2020-03

o Analytics Data Group Meeting
  - moving NY4 analytics layer out of their production area, new servers in production area, DP itself still in production area
  - scheduler: creating separate instance of existing batch scheduler, not reinventing the wheel
    - nightly summaries and stuff will be possible with this!
  - continued API development
    - year or two of data hard to manipulate, so Andrew adding parent-child model code
  - R support eventually
  - Snowflake Proof of Concept

x ping AFX about Term-90 discrepancy once I read through their latest emails

x outsource the VIX analysis project
. talk to Krista about files once
x get back together with Yoshiki this week

- dated date is same as issue date for CP and CD and it means start of interest accrual
- principal is face value of security
- intraday file is delivered via SFTP every half hour 8:15am to 7:15pm Eastern (ending on cumulative file)
  - end of day file containing all is delivered 7:15pm Eastern

- bigger spike vs. "persistent differential"

o VIXTLT
  - borrow risk-free rate r was 3M LIBOR
    - Paul McGeough: we could theoretically back out options-implied r and use that for the forward price in the VIX formula
      - question: is that too circular? VIX needs to be model-independent
  - IBOR in mid-September
  - FTP files - the EOD automated email file we want is probably not going to be FTP-able

x send email to McGeough, Alexandra Lynch, Krista Lynch, Steve Laipply
x issues with AFX response 1: is it DTCC issuers or AFX? cribbing too hard from BSBY filing - need to explain AFX vs. DTCC.
                              also, what about maturity weighting (like Hannover)?
                              Hannover raised Ameribor by 5bp when their rates were ~100bp off, can we get more range?
                  response 2: how can we emphasize how open committee is to change while giving an example from 35 years ago? and can we apply same
                              analysis to past 6 years to justify why it's currently at 250bp?

o Michael with Hilltop at Baseball
  - YAS screen for iBoxx would be really nice for adding legitimacy
    - should get BlackRock to help us push Bloomberg
    - we'd be wanting aggregated cash flows stats, but on what??
      - probably most current version of IBXXIBHY - maybe the 3 times a month list?
        - NO because Markit does those lists, BlackRock's actual holdings differ!
        - HYG should literally be best proxy, but we need to finish our project for answers!
  - Hilltop has people saying use CDX to hedge not iBoxx, so they need to prove
    - we can help with bespoke case, be prepared

. take Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday off for move-in!

x take a look at AFX study to determine top 2 issuers and histogram for how their maturities span (by volume)
  - Barclays (centered at 3 days to maturity) and Sumitomo Mitsui (centered at 7 days to maturity)
  - overall all issuers (3 years, 2018-2021) centered at 7 sweet spot of volume and multiplier;
    if just volume, 1 and 3 also big, but outweighted by effect from 28-35 small volume but big multiplier
- GNRL MTRS, HYUNDAI, AON, NISSAN, etc. all contributed huge 3-4% rates during 2020-03 to 2020-05

- pandas Reshaping Guide
  - "stacked"/"record" format - where a column is variable name and another is value
    - classic format: columns are 1) "date", 2) "variable", 3) "value"
  - .pivot_table() can handle duplicate index-column pairs, whereas .pivot() can't
  - .stack() converts nice column layer into "stacked" format, i.e. horizontal to vertical on left; .unstack() is opposite
    - stacked level becomes new lowest (last) multiindex level
  - .melt() holds a couple columns constant as "identifiers" and melts the rest into 2 "stacked" format columns (i.e. variable-value)
  - Grouper specification to group (like with time periods)
  - .to_string good for omitting NaNs?
  - .pivot_table() takes in an aggfunc=np.mean
    - margins=True adds subtotals
  - .crosstab() can be used for frequency counter (cross-tabulation)
    - note dropna=False is useful to look at full frequency cross-tab
    - note normalize=True or "columns" is useful for percentages instead of counts
    - note passing 3rd series and aggfunc can aggregate 3rd series accordingly
  - pd.cut(numbers, bins)
  - pd.get_dummies(df["key"]) to tally where each of the distinct keys appear in index
    - can use with discretization like pd.cut() inside to bin each index to a bin column
  - pd.factorize() to encode 1-D values as an enumerated type (-1 for NaN, others like 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
  - .explode() preserves index but converts lists within rows to 1-D standalone row elements

o Paul McGeough BBG call
  - Krista is on "that" side of the business with the files
    - but they are 100% not going to "bandage" obsolete file processes by creating an FTP, so no they won't send those files via FTP
  - our solution is to use https://filetransfer.blackrock.com/'s PCF files
    . need to study those and see what they have (seem to come at 3-4pm day of filename)
    . need to check on dividends - do they appear as an additional line on first of month?? (probably not??)
  - last resort, send jon.herttua@blackrock.com email, copy Krista and Paul, problem statement about the IBOR shares outstanding, how do I get?

. tell Michael about Paul McGeough, respond to Hunter

- 3 hedge strategies: traditional one to one hedge, the beta hedge, and the minimum variance hedge
  - beta hedge uses the regression beta (representing relative volatility) of the hedge tool
  - MV hedge uses correlation * std_s/std_f
- minimum variance hedge ratio
  - HR_sf = corr_sf * std_s/std_f
  - n_contracts_f = (HR_sf * n_s) / f_size

- R^2 is literally Pearson correlation coefficient squared; however, correlation is usually calculated with an implied INTERCEPT!
  - i.e. if we purposefully do no-intercept, we'll have a slightly different R^2-implied R from the default pd.corr()!
  - not 100% sure how the math works out, but the residuals are different if you force no-intercept
- oh my god OLS solution to the regression for beta_other is covar(standard, other)/var(standard), where standard is S&P 500, etc.
  - i.e. return_other = alpha_other + beta_other*return_standard + error
  - in HYG vs. IBHY1, alpha is 0 for no arb, and return_IBHY = beta_IBHY*return_HYG, and beta_IBHY = covar(HYG, IBHY)/var(HYG)

- Orbian, Hilltop among Dennis's list of no credit rating (need to be verified as investment grade by some party)
  - need periodic review process for qualification of issuers in white paper??
- it appears that AFX Prod Admin website is slightly better now (now have a broken "term 30" set of fields, but whatever)
  - may be able to accurately troubleshoot daily intermediates for Term 90 2021-03-25 myself, though we prefer Peter and Andrew to chime
- when rates are stressed, only IG will issue, but set of IG would become tiny - i.e. could be you need to reach back 40 days to get $25bn

- Account C0709956 (Goldman)
  - traded VIX from 2020-05 to 2021-02 (interesting pattern both TAS and standard)

- downside of using nearest term's daily settlement price (DSP) when BBO does not exist:
  flat settlement curve may lead to increased margins if price deviates too far from the prior daily settlement price
  - close alternative - apply delta (% change) from nearest term to the missing term

- last month, when I was defending carry-over as a superior Term-30 Ameribor fallback rate, I looked at the 1-day carry-over
  - 1-day is the best case scenario: assumes we don't have another consecutive day where we don't reach the threshold
    - however, consider what this is saying - if we are looking 10 days and can't get $10bn, that's on average less than $1bn per day,
      but consider this more realistic case: $2bn per day, usually 5-day window is perfect, then suddenly we hit a day with $0. then
      we just reach 6 days. imagine then it's 0s for the next 4 days. so
      2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0  0  2  2  2  1  2  2 2 2 2
      ....... 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 11 11 11 12 12 6 6 6 5
      - this lag effect is unexpected - the bad patch contributes little volume but takes up valuable lookback for 3,4,5, days
  - obviously, because of the lag effect and nature of liquidity, 1-day will almost never happen
    - I'm not sure what the analogous worst case scenario should be - the one time in history it happened (2020-03), it was 8 days
    - maybe we should have showed 5 days - in above example, if everything went back to "normal" 2s, we'd be back under 11 in 5 days
  - the BAD, BAD, BAD thing here is the fact that fallback rules until 5 whole days after market goes back to "normal" because lookback
    limit needs to pass out the bad patch!!!

- iBoxx - first examine what happens when plugging in IBXXIBHY and look at deltas during month for pattern

- Ameribor investment grade checking
  - planning: if we do have to somehow check every issuer every day, we should look into getting subscriptions from Moody's,
    Fitch, DBRS Morningstar, S&P, etc.
    - if they send a daily file with ratings changes or something, we can just scan those for our issuers
  - turns out we can do a Bloomberg FLDS query: match issuer names to Bloomberg CP/CD names, then query the short term credit ratings

- Krista trifecta - finally looking at these files
  - NAV Proof
    - PCF Identifier field contains some CUSIP (starts with 912), some SEDOL (starts with B)
    - the CUSIPs are confirmed found in "Non-Basket" file - what does that mean?
    - TLT 100,000 shares outstanding in a unit (easy enough)
  - figured out that Holdings file has superset of the trifecta; I think that implies Proof and PCF are create/redeem baskets (~10 fewer)
    notes than full set of holdings, and Non-Basket is separate to deal with cash holdings (shares left out)
    . but why on earth do Proof and PCF differ by 1 holding??
  - dug up from Krista email:
    "TLT PCF uses standard in-kind basket - this will be the actual list of securities you will deliver or receive for
     a creation or redemption, respectively. Please note the date convention – these files are published the evening before TD,
     so the basket for today (3/16) is labeled TLT_D_PCF_20210315.csv"
  - PCF filetransfer website timing: 2021-09-01 1:40pm Chicago: 2021-08-31 file is latest, date label is Aug 31 2021 15:52 (unknown TZ)

. MIGRATE YOUR 400SLASALLE TO OPO
  . ask Stange about Teams on Android lmaooo
  - Cboe phone for free data???
- timing of the files as well
- may need to go through calculation and what exactly it needs (with timings of IBOR/ABOR and why they matter) with Krista/Paul
  - highlight dividend need
- to Krista: need help understanding what's available, because it's not just PCF (from filetransfer website)
  - is the Non-Basket file supposed to be the entirety of the cash component in the whole ETF?
- to McGeough: what are you giving to Bloomberg? they are the only other ones trying to calculate ACF

. iBoxx - compare the 3 things: 1) Dimitrios method (correct the data) - how close it is, 2) pattern of IBXXIBHY,
  3) new method (if we have time, optimize the rolling period for correlation)

. oh god still need to look at correlation discrepancies between HYG and IBHY in April-present

x Arianne right at beginning of month (Wednesday/Thursday)

x Richard Sandor has okayed change from 5 to 10 day additional lookback limit for AMBOR90T
- Richard also wants additional 30 and 90 day stuff (like in arrears, etc.) with Numerix calculating
  - he's got a ton of stuff to throw at walls

- apparently only 100 people trade TRS CDS, so it's huge that we have 50 unique people trading iBoxx any given month

x write note about iBoxx
- Litch: "August was predictably quiet but it was still an encouraging month for client activity.
          3 new clients traded IBHY and 2 new clients traded IBIG.
          Goldman executed their first non-Union block with one of those new accounts – one in IBHY and one in IBIG (IBIG’s first block).
          Jump Trading also went live with IBHY in August and although they are starting small, they are layering the orderbook
          so the depth is better.  They have also traded a few lots against clients."
x IBIG block does not appear on Data Platform data thought???
  - found it - 2021-09-02 (not in August), C0709956 (that account we looked into on call), operator WRNAOX, 58 contracts, Goldman
  . mention this on September monthly trends!

x put Bob Siverson's LMM thing into Jira

- ETFs allow customized baskets for creation, increasing risk of index-tracking error
  - regulatory approach was never consistent, but said at first "pro rata" (proportional)
    - afraid otherwise would introduce liquidity mismatch risk to portfolios
    - "dumping" to convert illiquid assets to liquid ETF shares and "cherry-picking" to use just liquid part
      - using cash is a slippery slope too
    - ETFs with pro rata basket rules are disadvantaged compared to customizable composition
  - 2019-12-23 SEC new rule: those who engage in custom baskets must adopt a formal policy or procedure governing their construction.
    They must also keep internal records, while appointing specific employees with the responsibility of ensuring custom baskets
    comply with the formalised policies. And yet, do not have to publically disclose the customized baskets.
    - so still impossible for customers to track the error!
    - SEC may have wanted public the ETF’s daily portfolio composition file (PCF), needed to track
    - afraid of confusion “particularly if the basket is mistaken for portfolio holding information”
    - public may raise the risk that market participants front-run trades in basket securities or
      attempt to replicate AP or MM trading strategies
  - they SHOULD be making PCF available at end of trade day for what transpired during the day
    - this should be our reference for timing - should be ready for next trading day!

- Steve Laipply's forward duration is just discount the duration according to the options tenor for each version of VIXTLT (i.e. 1M, 3M, etc.)
  . what discount rate should we use? Eris? or CMT rates??
    . oh god, need to write bootstrapping code for CMT yields to bootstrap! seems doable

. important part of iBoxx HYG-Futures correlation is time-to-expiration; need to code up 1) 3-day roll version and 2) no roll version
  - consider that our "reset date" is first of month - that's day on which index=futures settle
. need to check performance of Dimitrios's version - after our version is done

. add regex into generate_expiries (and the other function that does something similar with fuzzy recognition)
  - other function is ensure_bus_day
  - solution is make a check_fuzzy() with arguments of 1) word to check and 2) the true word

x send Paul McGeough memo on 37 holdings vs. 28 holdings in creation basket
  - "Dixie" shares - IBOR -  I think Paul said Dixie was a location at some point
- Steve Laipply says just use what we use to discount our options (lmaooo it's literally wrong)

o Litch-Yayati's Raj Sharan
  - HYG options for dividends maybe
  - practical consideration - cash vs. HYG options delivering ETFs (?)
  - 1722 shares HYG to get same notional exposure
    - can go further for DV01, etc.
  - ETF and futures linked only by the index design
  - want to hedge some of the spread, HYG options you have to hold the interest (?)
  - running a fund to provide income to investors, holdings are cash bonds, ETFs and futures, want to leverage up exposure on futures
    - can they obtain leverage by shorting high yield futures and buying more cash bonds (latter is fully funded, but still)?
      - or is this against fund mandate?
        - Raj says not against mandate, but need to propose to higher ups
  - how can margin be met? can pledge T-bills, corporate bond holdings, etc. can discuss with clearing firm
  - Raj is a big fan of how Litch gets people on the table fast

- VIX indicative bid and ask indexes are called VWB and VXA internally, VXVWB and VXVWB on Bloomberg

x Tornatore, Arianne, Matt McFarland, Johnny Pesenti, and Michael are subscribed to old iBoxx Daily Report, so swap them over
  - subscribed by Vita, Vita, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie

o Bob Siverson-Charlie-Eileen - Ameribor LMM
  - single EFID? yes, confirm need on EFID level, but we only have by-firm data, yikes
  x update Jira for single EFID
  - Arb Trading, Clear, and Core (?) are the Ameribor quote makers
    - conveniently and maybe luckily, they are each only using 1 EFID

x Historical Daily Volume Breakdown - modify to have a filter to latest 1 date vs. 5

. recall for Tableau that you want to get through mining 1) CFE Activity Dashboard, 2) The Next N Table Calculations, and 3) CFE Market Quality and CTI Sizes

x remember to include forward duration memo to Yoshiki

> call Charlie to ask about: 1) how to re-aggregate to EFID instead of firm, 2) new development - no duplicate quotes - solvable?
  - "readily available" - does that mean it's still possible to re-aggregate and get what we want?

. at some point, we have to do something with Cboe Documents Library - for billing by firm, VIX futures customers in total,
  # contracts by TPH, how much we charged, etc.
  - Michael: IBIG numbers don't show revenue; Them: apparently we didn't set them up that way - iBoxx is all together, no HY vs. IG
    - Thomas Mueller was the guy who set that up
  - we can see for instance, how much Jump pays us in a month - we can use this info more!

- "fill and kill" - just send them the stuff, boom, checked off the list

- figured out the damn issue with Tableau historical volume breakdown last 5 days - they screwed up the Saturday if statement
  - how on Earth??? lmaooo
  x this explains why data source updates at 6pm apparently but we only show previous day's numbers! the fancy long Charlie code
    starts at 1 day ago! not 0 days ago (starting from TODAY())
    - if we add 0 days ago, we get flucuating 5 days and 6 days... what if we added another layer of if-statement oh wait that doesn't work
  - my solution in the end: add 0th day True-False (also simplified Charlie's code big time lol), do daily alerts with 0th day,
    manually set update time to like 7pm and see how we fare
    - this is literally why Vita's reports were blank day-of - it was prepping for 6pm data update before it could be useful

x tell Michael about iBoxx report breakthrough - daily report should be working now at 2am, but trying to adjust to 7pm
- ah damn it, Litch has been data mining old iBoxx report; new report is easier to navigate but much harder to data mine because
  there are more days and more products. arghh
  - in the "full data" of old report, some useful fields are Nat Best Bid and Nat Best Ask...

o Shelley Natenburg 1
  - forward price is price on a specific date (not today!)
  - present value is the opposite - it's what it is today
  - if you buy a stock, you lose interest gain dividends
  - E[stock] - exercise price = Call - Put
    - put-call parity, otherwise there's arbitrage
  - wait, how do dividends work with options?
    - don't affect the price of options, but affects the price of the underlying stock
    - PCP: C(1+rt) - P(1+rt) = F - X
      - remember that the money for both call and put has interest rate opportunity cost
  - 1900 Louis Bachelier higher math on options
  - 1973 Cboe - wild west of listed stock options
    - Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities (Fischer Black and Myron Scholes) from Bachelier - Black-Scholes model options on stock
  - 1997 Scholes and Merton (Black died in 1995) get Nobel in econ
  - 1976 Black model for options on futures
  - 1983 Garman-Kohlhagen model for options on foreign currencies
  - 1979 Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (binomial) model for American and European options (Black-Scholes only for European)
  - exercise price, time to exp, underlying price, interest rate, (dividends), volatility -> pricing model -> theoretical price
    - exercise price and time to exp are undebatable
    - underlying price has issue of bid-ask - must take opposite position of option
      - e.g. long call, short underlying; short call, long; long put, long; short put, short
      - how much though? (delta to be neutral, talk about later)
      - in a liquid market, mid price is fine, but in illiquid markets opposite position for bid-ask is useful
    - interest rate: textbooks will say risk-free rate, but few trade at that rate; free market default is LIBOR, i.e. Eurodollar futures
    - dividends: need for calculating forward price! amount of dividend is important, but we can also technically earn interest on dividends once they are paid!
    - volatility: the way we assign the elusive probabilities of where prices end up (for next time)
      - cannot observe, at all! every other input can be observed in some way or other
  - Q: options with increasing price and increasing volume, how do you think?
    - A: don't look at volume at all lmao, price is tied to volatility and theoretical value - what is the situation right now (not yesterday)?
  - Q: softwares on trading platform, why do we need to know theoretical value?
    - A: difference in opinion drives trading; theoretical pricing model is way of comparing opinion
  - Q: as LIBOR is phased out, what do you do?
    - A: SOFR is the preference, problem is it's not an accurate indicator of "free market" interest rate; professionals don't know either!

- Excel get around no short-circuit for OR =IF(ISNA(M2),1,IF(AND(H2>=K2,H2<=L2),1,0))

x look at HYG NAV returns as well
  - check if correlation is better?
    - A: NOOO. if you don't do total return, correlation already noticeably breaks down for every dividend at month start;
         it sucks even more for NAV. talking 99.6% TR vs. 99.0% price vs. 83.6% NAV (since 2019-07)
      - makes sense - people hedge using price, not NAV
x ask Frantz for more borrow rates
x look at correlation without 3 day roll, for curiosity
  - A: looks awful lmaooo notably 2020-01, 2020-06, 2021-04 have huge screw-ups near expiry
    - WAIT I'M DUMB - I did IBY1.pct_change() which doesn't work because of month disconnect. still need to handle returns
      of 2nd month sliding into place at the price stitch

x ping Charlie about possibility of the report
  - two-sided quotes - tracking specifically?

o Latest evaulation of Charlie's CFE Activity Dashboard
  . size & trades is nice, but can we take trades off and make adjustable? also make adjustable total size vs. average daily
  . give Charlie a reminder for to-dos on CFE Activity Dashboard
  - think about workflow: how do we quickly identify WHAT IS DIFFERENT AT A GIVEN TIME
    - think sorting by change from previous period, or a chart that quickly lets you see
  . be conscious of CHANGE - alerting based on CHANGE is very useful - try a sort-by-CHANGE sheet
  - should be IMMEDIATE workflow to see where things have CHANGED, and then we can say
    "here are 4 reasons why; can we expect these reasons to last?"
  - be aware of who the consumer is - if it's Arianne or Ed, they don't know about the data, don't care, need IMMEDIATE explanation
    on what to look at

- 2021-09-26 new OI timing; before, it was receive at 10pm for day-of, don't distribute until close 4pm next day, so everything
  was a trade day delayed
  - if you ever see an OI prior to 10pm of the day, it is almost certainly for the trade day prior (think of it as beginning of day)

o Charlie call
  - how potentially to re-aggregate to EFID instead of firm
    - A: solved - use order_summary
  - no duplicate quotes - what does it mean to leave out duplicate quotes, and is it solvable?
    - A: only would have been a problem for us in trying to find quotes made in final minute - if it's dupe, won't show up;
         but again, solved by using order_summary
  - "readily available" - does that mean it's still possible to re-aggregate and get what we want, it's just hard?
  - two-sided quotes - tracking specifically? seems like something that isn't tracked
    - A: order_summary it's lit
  - Tableau: how to create my own subscription frequency
    - A: not allowed - Charlie apparently didn't know about "on extract refresh" frequency
    - we went into CFE Order Fill Tableau source and deleted the Saturday night mandatory extract refresh which he says is legacy

x for Bob/Michael: spread quoting
x for Michael: didn't Ameribor have some 2pm final settlement?

- Markit rates - "VWAF - Value Weighted Average Fee, for all open ETF share loans on each day, annualized HYG"

o Albert Jimenez
  - servers AKA hosts: nfc1r1 - NFC related tables
                       nfc1r3 - allows you to see web tooling
                       nfc1r20 - since servers have limited disk space, we migrate data to our data warehouse environment
    - protected by RSA

- "churning" of physical network connections - Wolverine and XR buying tons of cross-connects to pound the pre-open

. be very careful inviting Steve Laipply to Applied Academics/Antonio call - give intro because they haven't met
  - emphasize we are not questioning anything here, we just want to have consistent rationale if academics ask

- Richard Sandor's dependency on us is CSMI distribution - he needs us to get data to Bloomberg
  - that seems like our single negotiating token
  - Cboe team is furious with Richard's behavior, knows he doesn't have a ton of capital, trying to spank him on it

- Joe Arcadi interested in iBoxx, went to Barclays, left for Bluecrest (based out of London, Arcadi in NY)
  - Litch pinged him, he says he wishes iBoxx would take off, but he's not bullish
  - but then Goldman pinged him and told him to get on it because he needs blocks

x tell Charlie: Ameribor changed from NEXT DAY to settlement day 2pm; reasoning is that first off DTCC stuff goes to 5 or 6pm,
  so we can't go all the way, and preliminary report comes out at 2pm, and we don't want people subscribed to DTCC to
  have an upper hand for last hour and 15
  - so in fact, for maturing contract, trading stops at 2pm instead of 3:15pm - we need to check if LMMs have quoting obligations
    on the settlement day
    - if yes, need to make code flexible to do 1:59pm-2pm on settlement day ONLY for maturing contract
    - if no, just need to eliminate expiring contract on settlement day from contract-days

- my differences from Dimitrios methodology
  - Hanweck vs. Markit borrow rates
  - 1-year rolling ratio vs. 6-month rolling regression
  - Dimitrios's code misusing "daily fee"
. should figure out how he was calculating the "spread_c1" - close bid-ask or time-weighted avg?

. idea: put GZAP permanently in PrdDevSharedDB

. ask Frantz about IBXXIBHY holdings vs. HYG holdings
  - check notionals of the differing holdings
  - check out 2021-05 reset

. try various rolling regressions
. get Yoshiki on the phone
  . is there another way to scale up and use HYG
    - Oliver from Goldman to Litch: he does not account for holdings difference between IBXXIBHY and HYG
    - Steve Laipply also just used HYG
    - minimum variance hedge ratio? try it

  - so for old BP TYVIX, we needed CTD MD for BP conversion, so we pulled full set of notes/bonds from TreasuryDirect,
    picked out useful fields, used CME criteria to determine the exact CTD note/bond
  - in the code, you can see exactly which fields I thought were "interesting" - the full set is huge, can see on website
    - tip for looking at website - json format is easier to use for API, but xhtml format gives a nice web browser visual

o NaN iBoxx fair value discussion 2021-09-22

    - me: it should def get us closer, but also we lose all dependency on the concept of "spot"
  - Nan: also, if we are looking to price 1st month, need to be careful at the roll - we should roll 2nd term in on maturity date
         instead of using the settlement index value (that would be 0th term here, essentially)
    - we lose all touch with IBXXIBHY
    - also be careful, need to track 2nd term price one day (or more, depending on how we want to handle roll)
      before rolling in so we can get appropriate new-number-depending-on-previous number
  - so conceptually does it still make sense to pursue a "spot" value?
    - consider how we would price 2nd term: normally for a future, we have spot that we use for 1st and 2nd term,
      but here, we use the 1st term to derive a "spot", but the "spot" doesn't matter for pricing 2nd term - why wouldn't we
      just use tangible 1st term to price 2nd term (especially if we're resetting each day and don't use a spot index at all)
    - is this a corruption of what it means to price a future?

x AFX Term-90 new supporting stats
  - 2020-03 break down each day # transactions and volume
  - also do a calculation input amount? note how many days we had to extend
  - do like a mean, std, median, quartiles for 2020-03 and compare it to rest of history 5 years

- throwback note: price percent vol vs. basis point yield vol: percent * price gets you the number of basis points;
  the important part to derive is the theoretical PRICE

o Litch - Western Asset (WAMCO)
  - 2 links: futures to ETF, and futures to Markit index
  - can see full orderbook on exchange - even in times of stress, more transparent about risk than OTC bank desk
  - residual "drops out the bottom" of ETF to become bond trading - ETFs are so popular
  - so customers seem to sell ETF during stress, but then create again afterwards
  - spread - evidence suggests the spread doesn't widen out in stress (??? wait really)
  - what does open up is price-NAV
    - Greece, 2012 - bonds not trading for weeks, ETF price went through roof, started marking own books using Grec-US
      - insane dislocation; Western Asset was trading it too
  - if you're holding bonds, you have creation/redemption as an option as an arbitrage channel
  - "any other examples of futures on illiquid underlyings"
    - consider commodity futures where storage costs are separate - few tankers of oil
  x "fast money" (what does that mean they keep saying it) vs. "real money"
    - fast money is leveraged used by hedge funds, shorter time horizon
  - remember that derivatives are actually more liquid than the bonds/Treasuries
  - bond basis being "fake" from stale is the real problem, dislocation not necessarily an issue because asset managers love that
    for arbitrage
  - futures mature against the NAV
    - ETF is a "side instrument", futures are not actually based on ETF but on the NAV
      - however, in tying to ETF in index construction, we secure a high correlation and liquidity outside of buying 2400 bonds
  - if you subscribe to Markit data (and if you're trading CDX, you are), you can get their duration numbers
  - Western Asset also wants quarterly futures to avoid rolling
    - our original thinking is just it was more straightforward to rebalance with the ETF

x ping Tiago for log files for VXTLT for 2021-09-22 8:30am to 10am
. also check random spiking - what's going on?
. spot check end of day - is it screwing the last tick?

- Hugh Flannery - Michael knows well
  - "premier asset manager" interested in iBoxx

- eventual language for Antonio and Yoshiki:
  "why would we use the duration at the forward point in time of options expiry instead of duration at the present as the BP conversion factor? I do not have any math in mind."

- Tableau tooltip - there is a default argument called "User Name", supposed to be for Tableau user; we have a minor conflict

. wait I'm dumb for iBoxx fair value I should be resetting at start of month, not end LMAO
  - the end is settlement - we should be rolling early

. Steve-Yoshiki/Antonio Call
  - say to Yoshiki/Antonio I have given Steve an email introduction to you guys, mentioned that you have been involved in VIXTLT
    and Treasury VIX methodology since day one, and that you guys have been championing the product and so need to stay updated on
    all the technical details in case academics inquire
  - say to Steve we already forwarded response, but for everyone's benefit could you give an overview for why forward duration
  x email Yoshiki (or mention it to Yoshiki on weekly call today): I don't want to moderate the discussion
  x also, Yoshiki can I go to your office and work/make the call from there on Friday
  . call it in denominator "average discounted duration" or something
    . ask Yoshiki in person to elaborate for purpose of us explaining in white paper
      . do you have some material I can read about this?
      . is it questionable at all that we refresh a new duration every day?
      . and then towards getting VIXTLT newsletter stuff to Steve, can we schedule a meeting with Pallavi and Danny?
        - keeping in mind Dennis and John Hiatt don't want them doing this type of thing going forward
  . we will send ticker with Bloomberg VXTLT
  . copy Paul on everything

x Bloomberg message Krista
  - she says Tuesday AM or Monday PM
  - "Gotcha, that sounds good! Just want to get a timeline for the team. Talk to you then"
. Bloomberg message McGeough
  x ask about IBOR/ABOR switch
    - "completed most of steps required, one outstanding - target is end of the month"
    . ask again at end of 2021-10
  > ask about possibility of making iShares website files more robust
    - Krista says no, don't recommend lol
  > mention that Steve would check in with him
  . talk about can they send us Aladdin number after IBOR/ABOR is done? with that, we can give up the chase on calculating ourselves
    - ideal is actually sending the accurate IBOR cashflows so we can load it and use live intraday prices to get "intraday" MD
      - but just having an Aladdin/Bloomberg/BlackRock official number or set of numbers is what we need
    - what if we got an Aladdin subscription? could you get us an FTP then?

- recall that our MD is actually BETTER than once per day - it's LIVE based on cash flows and price
  - next best would be Aladdin official MD, once per day
  - worst would be the once a month

x Litch thing ASAP

. ask Charlie about best way to get pre-2018 VIX data
  . also, what was the whole convo about order_summary not having accurate order times, etc.? what happened?
    - for futures, can we make a special case to just have all the data out there since there's not that much?

. ah, so expense ratio is already being subtracted from HYG - it returns less than IBXXIBHY when normalized!
  - so how should we account for that in calculation... boost HYG's daily returns by the expense ratio lol?
    - boosting prior to running regression should yield better result!

- I'm not crazy: Tableau Settlement+OI fields (Settle, OI, Open, High, Low, Close) used to go all the way back to 2013-05-20
  - Order Fill fields only go to 2018-02-26
  . why is this no longer the case?

. Tiago initial thought on VXTLT spikes/big shifts is just quotes widening shifting midpoint prices
  . update Steve/Paul thread and Yoshiki as things develop

o Pallavi-Danny-Yoshiki
  - gave me code, no documentation beyond code comments
  . look at what we have and check back in with Yoshiki

. mention on next AA-Michael call:
  - VIXTLT Newsletter status: repurposing Credit VIX code, how bespoke Treasury VIX content is relative to charts for Credit pros
  - let's just shortcut VIXTLT - once a month duration?

o Reed Staub, Meredith Shaw - Morgan Stanley - iBoxx
  - Litch: 2-way volume so important
    - e.g. hedging, speculating, 
  - IBIG - appeals to asset owners more than IBHY
  - Reed: we last called a month ago, not much has changed so we can't go in
  - Litch: how can we facilitate customers to come in; currently lots of firms dipping toe
  - one other big bank has started pricing on risk - facilitating block trades and the roll mainly
  - how would MS price if customers prompted? Litch suggests through order book there is more liquidity than they would expect

o Shelley - Understanding Volatility
  - I missed first 20 minutes
  - 256 useful as trading days in year because use sqrt(T) to unannualize volatility
  - 2/3 within (+-) 1 std, 19/20 inside 2 std
    - about once a month 2 std!
  - sqrt(1/52) = 1/7.2; sqrt(1/12) = 1/3.5
  - can look at 5 prices and say wait 1/3 wasn't outside of 1 std, maybe our vol is bad
  - lognormal because downside tail bounded at 0 (looks pretty similar to normal tbh, but skewed to the right (peak to left))
    - so at forward price 100, 110 call (3.2) should theoretically be more expensive than 90 (2.8) put
      because more possibilities upward (lognormal)
      - HOWEVER, IRL puts are more expensive! (2.9 vs. 3.1) people disagree with model - when market falls, it falls hard
        - "up by the stairway, down by the elevator"
  - when people say vol, it's confusing: realized vs. implied (future realized)
    - realized = value, implied = price; if price is low, buy, if high, sell
    - how to predict implied?
      1. look at historical (realized) vol
        - longer rolling easier to predict, but your pricing could be way off!
        - remember to shift if and only if comparing realized to implied (VIX); VIX higher than realized over predicted periods
      2. volatility forecasting model
      3. just use the marketplace consensus (implied) vol
  - B-S: exercise price, time to exp, underlying price, interest rate, VOLATILITY; vol is discrepancy if your B-S is off from market

. send heatmaps to Hunter as reference
  - as I recall, we have 1) overall volume, 2) volume increase/decrease, 3) percentiles
. look back through notes for how to handle long and short
  - maybe maker/taker?
  - maybe monthly timing of when they close? if they close within 3 days of maturity or something, ignore those buy/sell keep the rest
    - simultaneously track open interest per firm (if available) - big decrease in OI corresponds to closing out, so look at everything else
o Hunter Alerting Tool
  - clearing firm better to avoid Firm ID's pipes (e.g. TTCH, CQCI not great, want the deeper)
    - CQCI's ABNO (ABN) is TD Ameritrade
  - no trades in 30 days is pretty cool - ADV while trading as bars is nice touch
    - however, need to consider how Ed Tilly would look at it - "4 accounts from Morgan Stanley have dropped out, here's why"
    . need some way to see if volume has just transferred to different Morgan Stanley account... but how?
      - show by MPID? track increase and decrease

. how much does modified duration change in a month where rates rose?
  - argument against once-a-month duration VIXTLT

. by Friday: Arianne volumes

x SPX realized vol send to Michael
  - note to self: log returns requires natural log! because it depends on e^r, not 10^r
x send to Michael # trades and average size per account
  - "number of customers/average trade size for Q3"

. check in with Charlie
  - LMM
  - OI+Settlement 2013 historical data query fix
  - random occasional data extract refreshes
  - where do "revenue" numbers come from?

. ask Tiago about ustf whether it interrupts DICE

- consider that rolling futures contracts does NOT impact P&L - you are closing one and opening another
  - your capital invested may increase, but that's not a loss!
  - this "roll cost" is not a bad thing - but must consider that each day we roll down term structure to spot
- Seeking Alpha Brent Osachoff M1:M2 contango adjustment using days to expiry - clever to avoid roll
- the article you read years ago by Vance Harwood on Six Figure Investing called The Cost of Contango: basically just
  "the roll does not cause P&L; the roll is closing out one contract's P&L and opening another's; the decay is from migrating down the term structure"
  - you read the article on Invest in Vol which was founded by Stuart Barton. small world
- "futures risk premium" refers to the contango decay; "volatility risk premium" refers to VIX from a month ago over subsequent realized SPX vol
  - FRP contango decay i.e. VIX futures term structure comes from SPX implied volatility which comes from
    1) portfolio insurance - people buy protective puts and roll them month after month, implying volatility in future
    2) leverage - subtle, but tons of long equity people use options dated far out purely for long leverage
- so apparently the Greeks come from Taylor series expansion of multivariable function (variables affecting portfolio price are
  time, spot price, interest rate, volatility, dividends, etc.)
  - the gamma-theta relationship happens when you hedge away delta with futures and get gamma parabola minus theta
    - the more price movement (either direction) the more likely you are to overcome theta loss with gamma winnings
      - this gamma effect is an option's convexity - strong 2nd order effect of spot price!
  - histo vs. implied bet is gamma scalping! betting that theta will outweight gamma (short gamma, short options) is skimming vol prem
  - vol surface:
    - long term, institutional buy long-dated puts;
      long lower strikes lifted
    - everyone sells upper calls (covered calls, collars) for option premium yield as source of income (losing upside);
      medium-to-long upper strikes capped
    - short term, penny wing options (small puts and calls way OTM) desirable; high IV
  - as a result, longer-dated more expensive than shorter-dated; term structure (ATM on surface) sloping upward
    - shorter term moves fast though
  - consider flexibility of vol surface at any given time for a gamma scalper - one historical vol, many options (pun) for implied vol
    - if sell longer-dated options, have to carry hazardous position
    - longer options have less gamma! gamma-theta play harder because need many more options
    - longer options prices are much more sensitive to vol (explicitly vega, i.e. a % represent way more $) - need to have idea where going
    - consider that shorter-dated OTM drop in price to pennies really quick
  - large MMs oscillate between long and short gamma
    - macro views
    - taking huge trades from clients: corporation issuing warrant/stock-option plan
    - index vs. stocks! can trade stocks' gamma positions against each other, or DISPERSION (short gamma on index, long on components)
    - overall trader book constraints - may take position to get overall in line
  - some never oscillate:
    - insurance buyers always buy puts!
    - OptionSellers and Catalyst always sell options - do decently but risky
- part 2: volatility increase from panic of stock drop (people short covering put positions) amplifies gamma losses
  - example of ATM call vs. OTM put - different shapes of P&L
x finish reading rabbithole of Gamma then Grimes refresher; then will have better understanding of futures term structure

- CEDX is Cboe European Derivatives Exchange I think
  - Michael and Litch knew it's going to fail, has no volume as of late 2021-09

- can apparently enter block rolls (spread trades) as single order; not sure how that ends up in Data Platform because
  I've never seen something labeled Block and Spread (need to check if same field)

. respond to Litch on Kelly thread

- Bloomberg ETF premium/discount page - apparently HYG went into discount on 2021-09-29 - Litch thinks it's screwing our IBHY roll bid-ask spreads

o Hidden Liquidity in IBHY and IBIG Futures
----
- iBoxx allowed in most mandates - mainstream product; institutional size
  - futures wrapper useful appealing to broad base of clients: asset owners, credit funds, CTAs, high-net-worth investors
  - track liquidity of HYG without directly tracking its securities
  - buy-side can 1) use futures for hedging when ETF outside of fund's mandate, 2) add leverage, 3) go short easier, 4) manage duration (CDX can't)
  - as long as MMs have the liquidity to hedge in the super-active ETFs, futures are liquid
  - Litch: traders may be used to estimating 10% of ADV as liquid size, but here we have to think differently about liquidity
  - Litch: phase 5 of uncleared margin rules (UMR) in 2021-09 - move out of OTC swaps and into centrally-cleared products
  . what does it mean for an ETF to be "fully funded"
  - for leverage, otherwise would have to do TRS which is OTC and subject to UMR and fewer dealers pricing
  - CDX HY and IG are established and liquid, but not always right fit - credit component but not duration risk, 100/125 names vs. 1300/2400
  - $12B/$8B in 2021Q2 following MM program in 2020-03 and 2020-07
  - trend-following CTAs; if another taper tantrum, opportunistic buyers could meet the sellers - end investors will trade with each other
- origin of iBoxx: Cboe wanted futures on HYG/LQD; IHS Markit and BlackRock independently had enquiries from firms approved for FI
  but not for securities more widely
  - made sure it is futures on a cash index, as security futures (through SEC reg) are less eligible for mandates
  - in Europe, fund managers with UCITS wrapper are restricted from investing in non-UCITS funds including 1940 Act ETFs;
    this would have been problem with futures on HYG/LQD; 10% cap on transferable securities/money market instruments by same body
  - CTAs literally could not trade credit before
  - insurance clients can use for cash management - they take premiums early in the month but can't deploy into cash bonds so just
    park it in US Treasury, which creates a benchmark imbalance; parking in HY/IG picks up basis points and improves tracking error
----

o CP3 - Dennis leading
  - very similar to Term-30, change is 41-120 instead of 2-40+1
    - commercial paper and certificates of deposit
    - no AFX trade data is included
  - Gaibo replicated every number
    - note to self: on 2021-09-16 Andrew Brown confirmed their error on 2021-03-25 that they forgot to filter by $1MM minimum,
      which led to a few ~$750k trades making it in
  - need index to be vetted for investment grade - using 2 rating agencies each to verify IG
  - level of concentration vetted, want to diversify - 5 largest issuers as percentage of principal, largest was 13.95%
    - 2016-06-01 to 2021-05-28, same we used for everything
    - we aren't required to run this test, we just did it for comfort
  - we didn't run correlations between LIBOR and Term-90 because at these low rates, changes are amplified and misrepresent
    - so we use spread between the two
  - Art and Margolis put in long page of explanation
  - noticed that there is wording of "may" in "AFX may exclude CP if it's not investment grade"
    - currently arguing for wiggle room on not doing the strict check every single day; however, for procedure, AFX will exclude all
  - average basis between 3M LIBOR and Term-90 is stable and less than 1 basis point! std 5.6bp
  - $10B minimum from the pool for any calculation
    - on average $13B, 475 transactions
  - excluding outliers - transaction's rate of interest 250bp away from previous day's rate, we will eliminate it

x create_percentiles_rank Block 0 percentile is somehow messed up, at least for IBHY...
  - it's because .rank() needs edge case method for ties - when we have 100 0s and 100 non-0s, we prob don't want 0 to rank 0.25

x add block and quarterly info for IBHY
  x then do for IBIG

o Data Group Meeting
  - Snowflake for Data Platform
  - Analytics Layer - still moving towards broader use, talk to them for business need
  - Tiago: how do we request history?
    Andrew: can go back for C1 and C2, our tool only works with BATS tech, so going back further is not possible sometimes.
            started loading some stuff into a PostGRES database, not easy though. if you need something, reach out to our team.
            Paresh deals with this a lot. generally don't want to keep everything in our database for space/speed concerns
  - Ellen from RegDev: Snowflake - are y'all making roadmap to migrate DP to Snowflake?
    A: moving Hadoop to Snowflake - benefit is if a bunch of queries are coming in, we are limited to 12 nodes on the cluster,
       but with Snowflake we can query as many as we want; can speed up performance of queries by giving them unlimited power.
       Snowflake still uses SQL, seems it should be similar set of supported functions

- bring to Dennis's attention:
  1) Hilltop and Orbian have bizarre percents that are pretty far from AMBOR90T - possibly not investment grade
  2) removing them result in 3rd decimal change to AMBOR90T - is that a problem

- pretty sure Excel's "General" format code is just a huge number of # significant digits after decimal - it doesn't display past 9
  after the decimal; so there is no "magic" best format; priority is to align decimal and account for negative sign space tbh

. Krista - clarify on the IBOR/ABOR question

. let's put language together for Steve and otherwise - we don't need another call - just explain why we would not use forward duration
  and send it to Steve
  x email Yoshiki
  . work with Pallavi to put this new language into white paper

. look at Bloomberg comparative returns IBY1

- for the record, VXM first day ever CTI 4 volume looks mega high because account MDG through RJO used 4 instead of 2

x send Yoshiki the latest white paper
  . ask for help on futures

. need to add some GTH trends (with VIX_Pivot) into next monthly futures trends

- Krista email info
  - "NAV proof is on an accounting basis which is holdings as of T+1"
    . gonna need to break that way down: what does it mean to say "holdings as of T+1"
      . what time of day are we talking? if the file is labeled 2021-10-13: 1) is that T or T+1? 2) what time and date is that 2021-10-13
        file actually created? 3) with those details clear, what does it mean to say holdings as of T+1?
        - it is meaningless to me to keep saying T vs. T+1 because those can mean anything at this point
  - "the website is on a lag and has some other slight differences.
     We don’t advise using the website for calculations requiring real-time precision"
    . wait, I thought website file has IBOR, which updates in a more timely fashion than ABOR?
  - "20,697.08 in TLT_D_PCF_20210930.csv and 09.30.2021 TLT.xlsx. What were the file names you were comparing?"
    . I literally just checked 2021-10-01 and they are off by 2 cents lmao
  - "Estimated cash is our best estimate of where cash will come in for a given trading day for market-making purposes. It is finalized when NAV is struck."
    . what does that even mean lmao? what does it mean to be finalized? if it is an estimate, does it matter?
  - "other elements in the cash component, such as management fee accrual and fund expenses"
  - "PCF and the NAV proof have differences based on settlements.
     The NAV proof explains NAV and the PCF shows what will be in the creation or redemption basket for a given day.
     In this case, it is most likely a component was moved to the non-basket or traded from the fund"
    . this is why I keep asking about the relative times: it clearly matters the order in which things happen. please give me that.
  - "NAV, Shares Outstanding and Market Value(Net Assets) in the Daily Values report and on BBG are ABOR based"
    - holy Christ this is actually helpful. Daily Values is kind of the grail - file from 2021-10-08 7:09pm with 2021-10-08 in title but 
      trade date 2021-10-11 inside is apparently ABOR, and it matches PCF file with 2021-10-08 in title on NAV, Shares, and Market Value
  - "prices and MV in the holdings data on iShares.com are IBOR based"
    - actually helpful. enlightened breakdown:
      holdings file "as of" 2021-10-07 shows Shares from ABOR 2021-10-06 BUT THEN ALSO HOLDINGS FILE MARKET VALUES "AS OF"
      10/6 IBOR 14.737 ABOR 14.736 | 100.8 vs. 102.1
      10/7 IBOR 14.886 ABOR 14.882 | 102.1 vs. 104.2
      10/8 IBOR 15.111 ABOR 15.107 | 104.2 vs. 106.5
    - so once and for all: IBOR vs. ABOR makes very little difference - we just need all the same numbers on the same page
      - once again, it's the timing that is confusing us: maybe at the time the holdings file is generated, IBOR MV is close to ABOR but
        the new Shares hasn't been created yet
    - once and for all: the holdings file from website is not usable because Shares and MV are not on the same page
    . this entire time, we've been referring to the ABOR/IBOR change nebulously as the "ABOR/IBOR change" - what exactly are you guys changing?
      . because for all we care, we are happy with the ABOR info a la Daily Values - just give us a list of holdings in addition to the
        Daily Values in an FTP (or anything more production-friendly than a nightly email around 7pm-8pm Chicago) and we'll be on our way
      . we don't seem to "need" IBOR

. ETF scrape failing mny days in a row - 2021-10-06
  . check what happened
    - 2021-11-01, 2021-10-15, 2021-10-11 classic 1kb file issue
    - different issue!!! on 2021-10-05, 2021-10-04, 2021-10-01, 2021-09-30
      - no ustf file generated on 10/4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 19, 11/3
        - i.e. issues with TLT files on 9/30, 10/1, 4, 5
        - LMAOOOO on 9/30 they are just randomly missing 3 columns: CUSIP, ISIN, SEDOL. what in the hell
        - LMAO on 10/5 it is also just no rows of data, so bad for a different reason
        - fixed on 10/6
  . message Sasha, Terrance Mayfield, MJ, Ron Sakata to clear things up
  . meet with Tiago - ask about making file scrape later
- related, but not really: 2021-05 had a bunch of "bad unicode" files - can read with encoding='windows-1252'
  - 2019-08-20 had no HYG ISINs!!! usually it's iBoxx FTP files with missing stuff

. check on VIXTLT spikes
  . lean on Tiago: ask if he has code for reading log files
  - expand detail of project - 3 day project

x GTH information from John Palmer
  x average daily RTH vs. GTH trading volumes from 2020-01-01 to 2021-09-01 for: AMB1, AMB3, AMT1, AMW1-5, VX, VXM1-53, VX1-53
    - damn, we have ADV for pretty much everything except RTH-GTH
  x add RTH/GTH to settlement lookup dashboard
    . consider that for dashboard, we may want a crosstable to say GTH-TAS vs. GTH-Standard, GTH-customer vs. RTH-customer, etc.
  . fix Percentiles to automatically split off Weeklys as default (but also include a combined VX for convenience)

. try putting roll cost as an extra % change into futures returns
  - this is clearly not right: when you buy, you open a futures position; you don't lock in P&L return until you sell and close the
    position; that position's loss is already counted once in the daily returns that trend downward, we shouldn't double count the costs
    - however, this implies that if we sum the roll costs, it should give us a "one-number summary" of the term structure
  . Yoshiki has responded: read the S&P white paper he sent, set up call to discuss
    - takeaways: 1) "short-term" futures index AKA 1M different from "front month" futures index; latter does final 3 days roll, 1/3 each
    - they roll notional, not # contracts; we should absolutely be doing that - dollar amount is what's being hedged against HYG

o Yoshiki-Antonio Discussion of White Paper
  - Antonio finally brings up math: integral of D_t estimated by D_0 constant, meaning since we can't know how duration will change in
    the upcoming period from 0 to T, we estimate it to be constant
    - in other words, our approximation is that the duration we provide is what we believe to be the average for 0 to T
    - forward duration discounting doesn't make sense - duration throughout period matters, not just the duration at the end
  . respond to white paper final language
  . Michael: does convexity matter?

x Bloomberg message Krista with my availability to put onus on her
  - well I did and she responded with "hey!" and nothing else

x Kaitlin Meyer - by Wednesday reconcile numbers on spreadsheets
  x read business plan and look at dashboard
  - took a look - she got Charlie to put the options dashboards and futures (VXM+VX CTI 4 accounts) sheets together
    - I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do though

. respond to Florian lmao
  . read papers

- in options world, "retail" is a classification for 100 or 10 or fewer options
  - for futures, regular 1 or 2 lots is still suspiciously institutional

. put together schematic to explain our basis point VIXTLT calculation process
  - think about interchangeable parts: plan A vs. plan B vs. plan C fallbacks at each node

. talk to Pallavi about putting language in; mention citing the math if Yoshiki has paper in mind

. ask about pulling Heston Plus OVDV in bulk from help desk

o Kaitlyn Meyer retail VXM meeting
  - consider using 6 months instead of 1 month to judge account resilience
    - our issue is of course that VXM has only existed for 12 months
  - need deeper way to track who returns and when
  - my takeaway from spreadsheet: 6000 total people who have been so motivated that they came and traded a contract
                                  2600 (43%) have bothered to come back a month later at least once; most never maintained an interest
                                  800-1000 (1/3 of those return customers) are active in any given month, contributing to health of product
  - take revenue break-even ADV, consider customer share of 8-10% (divide by 10), divide by 9 contract volume per customer not using big VIX;
    - that gets us how many UNIQUE customers need to be trading EACH DAY
    - e.g. Big is trading 200k, for Minis to be 10% contribution need 200k Minis, customer share 20k, 2k unique customers each day for that
. VXM spreadsheet brainstorming - consider some extra check-box features in the code
  . for each account, for each day, month, quarter, year, have a binary active/not active mark
    - can use this to score how regularly active it is
    - note: must mark NaN for days/months/quarters/years where it didn't exist, False for no trade, True for trade
    . add one bespoke month(adjustable to quarter or 6 months, as Kaitlyn suggested)-based feature: % days active per each month
      - have a max() on this to see how active an account was "at its most active"
  . aggregate those tallies Premier League form style
o Follow-up Kaitlyn Meyer one-on-one
  - need to create baseline - past 2 years
  . ping Charlie for revenue explanation
  . ask about new accounts spreadsheet in Tableau
    - new accounts across VIX and VXM
    - configurable "new" to 6m, 1y
    - share Big VIX spreadsheet, work on baseline
      - by-firm baseline (mean is fine), last year vs. year-to-date

. update ProShares material to figure out what on earth happened 2021-10-20 extreme TAS volume, ProShares ABUPROSH sell Nov (far term)

. futures storage cost is why it returns less

- XR - Deutschebank screwed something up and reversed it
  - do we see that in the data though?
  - what about Wolverine? also what happened on 2021-10-20?

- what the actual hell. in recent versions of pandas, we're getting precompiled pd.DateOffset() tseries offset.py library?
  - when you go to source, it's created by generator??? which is screwing up type definitions

. REPL in Tableau?
- figured out how to sort descending date filters lmao it is not trivial - need to create a Set and set default sort on the set
  and then replace the previous MY(dt) filter with the set filter

o Keith Botti
  - more liquidity in Bitcoin ETF than people think
    - Michael mentioned they may hit position limits
  - beginning days of VXX was tail wagging the dog, but liquidity met the demand
  - our question: what happened this week in TAS?
    - Tuesday was 65k TAS, especially towards end of the day; we didn't see any big creates
    - Keith says he's been busy, literally doesn't know
  - XR didn't know what happened (other than Wolverine fat finger)
  - VolatilityShares got 2x and 1x inverse approved, do you have appetite?
    x 33 Act fund, ProShares was running out of shares and had to tune some create variable??
      - define up front how many shares they're gonna issue, with reverse splits and increased issuance, they were getting high
        - instituted creation fee (for APs) to slow it down, intended to reverse that at some point
    - Gensler came out with statement against "complex products"
    x what was it that he said about August new rules on sharing "registering shares" between funds?
      - we followed up with cancelling out SVIXY against UVXY (Michael also not sure what he meant)
        - one of the biggest reasons they delevered in 2018-02 was that their margin was greater than cash held by ETF,
          RBC wouldn't net the positions (they still had a substantial short position, so surprising)
          - SocGen wrote them 100s millions swap to bail them out and get them back under their cash holdings
            - it's like a gas valve for them that they still use today
        - Bitcoin they can net, but says this is a different issue completely
    - how would you re-lever?
      x need to file an 8K, probably a formality; piece of information that could influence stock price, obligated to tell
        - prospectus change is less high profile for sure
      - options MMs were angry about them adjusting leverage in 2018, made a lot of calls
      - need to check with their prod dev team to gauge appetite between filing new product vs. re-levering
    - recall VolatilityShares actually avoids TAS with "guardrails" - 15 minute TWAP instead of TAS 30-second VWAP
      - so not exactly the same product - they are not strictly targeting TAS and we are not creating a separate TAS for them
      x Keith looking at "options on each side"??
        - he means like embedding long calls in SVXY to protect against spikes (long vol protected by put more likely for approval)
        - we're going to have mid-curve options (options on futures!!), may help options on each side
        - talking about VXX options - partially option on Nov and partially on Dec futures, imagine it expires in late Nov though,
          at that point it's actually a bet on Dec and Jan futures - very interesting way to trade VIX term structure
          - next step out would be listing options on calendar spreads?? easier with options than outright in futures
        - CPM (customer portfolio margin) is wanting to be able to margin VIX options against VIX futures
          - I didn't realize VIX options are securities and can't be offset against VIX futures as commodities
          - Goldman, etc. aren't too bothered because they have so much excess leverage, but still important
    x double jeopardy from government
      - talking to Angelo Evangelou about it, he says it's unlikely they'll reopen it, ink's barely dry
      - going back 4-5 years, pre-Trump, SEC proposed rules around derivatives (or ETPs that held derivatives) focused on levered/inverse ETPs
        limiting leverage, regulating underlyings
        - doesn't get done, Trump appoints Jay Clayton, Republicans watered the rule down and passed it in 2019
      - Trump loses, Kara Stein puts hold on VelocityShares and goes back to reference the rule, raise specter of revisiting the rule
- VIX kind of works like interest rates - can carry over trading techniques

. check in with Krista again

. return decomposition (on iBoxx) - price depreciation, roll cost, etc. how much does each do

o Futures Fee Schedule Project
  - Futures RPC ~$1.8 (2-sided, 2 fees)
  - Jump, HFT guys very price-sensitive; Jump highest tiers of rebates - 48 cents per contract
  . evaluate cost changes for each firm if we get rid of the "percent share" tier
  - LMM incentives got changed to by-EFID, but TPH tiers are still by firm ID (combined EFIDs)
  . need to understand who it affects, e.g. who got incentivized to trade just up to 500 contracts by the super lower tiers
  - people at the top and at the bottom are most affected (especially by base rate change from $1.1)
  - steps: 1) match monthly fees for VIX, 2) tweak to see impact

o XR Trading TAS Event Discussion 2021-10-25
  - Tuesday fat finger 12,000 lots, turned around in minutes and traded right back out ON SCREEN (not block)
  - Tuesday pre-open going into Wednesday
    - monthly expired, front month usually 0 at 1, second -1 at 0
    - someone had a bad mapping in their roll - something was missing big time, sat in pre-open for 15 minutes somehow, very bad
    - looked like at 6pm or 7pm they had backed out of it, so didn't seem intentional
  - on Wednesday, we ended up trading 183k TAS??
    - the unintentional pre-open accounted for around 100k, but the remaining was still crazy high
      - related effects - position management effects to other MMs, including XR; ancillary scrambling
  - did you guys see anything functionally wrong with TAS? or just one guy screwing up
    - the prior is their impression; surprised at resilience of TAS - if you just look in the morning, you wouldn't suspect what
      happened previous night
    - bid-ask spread didn't get pushed over
  - Michael offered to connect XR to VolatilityShares for block possibilities - they won't exactly be doing TAS
    - Stuart Barton -> Matthew Haraburda, Nicholas Michaels, Ken Xiahou

o Kaitlyn Meyer/Michael follow-up
  - secondary pool incentive taken away, immediately after first month
  - Jane Mini vs. Big
  - Jump treating them separately, churning Minis

o Shelly Natenberg - Volatility Spreads, Part 1
  - position in one or group of contracts and an OPPOSING ANOTHER position or group of contracts
    - position: direction, vega, gamma, rho, etc.
  . how might we spread off our delta risk?
    - sell underlying, sell 
  - if we sell puts, how to spread off gamma risk?
  - why spread?
    1) relative mispricing between contracts
    2) construct position that reflects particular view of market conditions
    3) you need to manage risk of position (in short run)
  . usually delta-neutral, sensitive to gamma () or vega (implied volatility)
  - Straddle - the most common type of vol spreads
    - call & put; delta-neutral ATM, but NOT OTM!
    - could buy 3x call vs. 1x put (ratio spread) when above underlying price
    - long: delta 0, gamma +, theta -, vega +
  - remember: prior to expiration, curved graph; at expiration, locking in P&L, you get the traditional straight lines
  - Strangle - most spreads will be variations on straddles and strangles
    - call & put, different strike, usually 1-to-1 (not ratio) chosen by choosing cancelling delta
    - usually OTM, but ITM is also delta-neutral - it has a name: "guts"; super capital-intensive ($1 OTMs vs. $20 ITMs)
    - P&L shape: upward trapezoid - wider strike range of lossing money than straddle basically
      - question of leverage: can usually do several strangles for price of straddle!
    - delta 0, gamma +, theta -, vega + (bigger per dollar than straddle though!)
  - Butterfly - 3 options, different strikes; call or put are same and can both be long
    - +1 July 95 call, -2 July 100 calls, +1 July 105 call (wing, body, wing)
    *- we call "long" if we have to PAY OUT MONEY for the position
    - min value: 0, max value: 5! if you end up between 95 and 105, you make some money
    - calls and puts are the exact same... for European options
    - P&L shape: covered upside-down straddle
    - 100 straddles - pretty big risk; 200 butterflies - no one bats an eye
    - delta 0, gamma -, theta +, vega - (same as SHORT straddle, but again, less leveraged)
  - Condor - buy outside strikes, sell inside strikes; same as butterfly in that it's all calls or all puts
    - +1 July 90 call, -1 July 95 call, -1 July 100 call, +1 July 105 call
    - P&L shape: covered downward-facing trapezoid
    - risk characteristics: like a SHORT straddle: delta 0, gamma -, theta +, vega -
  - Ratio Spread - most traders think of it this way; non-symmetrical
    - buy more than sell, or vice versa (people used to say front or back spread): +3 OTM calls vs -1 ITM call
    - left side covered long straddle (long 3x OTM call)
    - "sell more than buy" (want to sit still) or "buy more than sell" (want to move) delta 0, gamma +, theta -, vega +
    - gamma and theta always opposite, but vega not necessarily
  - Ladder - buy 1 more valuable, sell 2 less valuable
    - long call ladder: +1 March 95 call ($7), -1 March 100 call ($4), -1 March 105 call ($1)
    - left side covered downward-facing trapezoid (looks like SHORT STRANGLE!)
  - bearish butterfly 90/95/100 when price is 100 - max profit is at 95
  - call and put butterflies/condors should be priced the exact same!
  - most ratio spreads are done with fairly simple arithmetic
  - what about iron butterfly and iron condor lmao? variations, for next time
    - will talk about synthetics!

. ask Litch about BMO (started playing IBIG big time last month) blow-up
  - Jump seems to have realized they screwed up, will be out indefinitely
    - maybe screen isn't as accurate as for VIX
    - shame because front month screen liquidity increase from Jump being in was incredible
    - Michael wants to penalize MMs for scattering whenever an 8-lot comes in
    - basically Tom (Clear/Prime?) just making markets, everyone else piggybacking
  - Virtu - guy Alex disconnected from how badly product is actually going
    - we expect them to trade more (also Flow, why aren't they trading more?)
      - must be margin offset
  - open interest is our problem now
  - Jane wouldn't come in for any incentive

o Al Flosi, formerly of Wolverine - Us asking about last week TAS
  - currently unemployed, not allowed to work until December, going to DRW (secret!)
    - DRW hoping to grow business in vol; frustrated at Wolverine at just being a TAS player
  - -1 at even makes sense for near term... but how does it actually work?
    - logical standpoint, makes sense, but in reality sometimes not
    - at Wolverine they would just go with how markets are
  - all TAS orders got there at 4:45pm, people who put in -1 at 0 (Wolverine, Al doesn't know) didn't seem to realize
    - 120k happened in a flurry right there at the open
  - what accounts for the excess? ProShares said it was just they ended up managing a different position than expected, so traded more
    - potentially had to modify non-TAS trading, maybe creation/redemption based on TAS position to cover to get out of TAS position
      - we didn't see any big create/redeem in any of the big ETPs though
        - Al points out that they can at any one time be hedging TAS with ETF, but then just create and redeem within same day
          - invisible to us at EOD, but could be part of the risk cycling behind the scenes intraday
        - MM can say "we want to create 100MM UVXY", ProShares would have had a bigger role
          - but Al pointed out that we wouldn't see that until the next day, if at all
  - UVXY is ETF, so usually more generous in terms of shares outstanding (vs. ETN)
    - Al doesn't remember Feb creation fee, but says this is common
    - either 1) make creates really expensive (pushes price to premium, day traders keep trading but institutional stop)
      or 2) cut creates entirely (pushes price to even higher premium, changes environment)
      - TVIX had 100% premium! swaps with shares of TVIX to get you out of position with XIV
        - sell TVIX at big premium but give you XIV to help you offset? I don't entirely understand
  - VolatilityShares - Al aware
    - SVXY didn't lose as much as XIV because XIV as an ETN has obligations but ETF doesn't, so they could just not roll
    - Al had XIV in his personal account loool but doesn't recommend it for people who aren't aware of when to not hold risk

. need a better tool to 1) look up firm (search even if haven't traded this month),
                        2) look at what month contracts they traded on any given day,
                        3) track their OI

- if prices are lognormally distributed, then returns (log(1+r)) is normally distributed, which is nice
  - log(1+r) = r for small r
  - note the product of normally distributed variables is NOT normal, but the sum is (when all are uncorrelated)
    - log(1+r_i) = log(p_i/p_(i-1)) = log(p_i) - log(p_(i-1))
    - log(p_n/p_0) = log(1+r_1) + ... + log(1+r_n) which is NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED
  - a lot of finance based on continuous time stochastic processes
    - so they assume log returns...
- some markets assume returns as "invariants" - they behave identically and independently across time, so past predicts future
- linear returns actually aggregate across securities - just weight by weight of security in portfolio!
  - log return also called "compounded return"
    - ooooh. I see. mathematically it means exp(log(p_1/p_0)) so it gets exactly the correct return continuously compounded
    - compounded returns actaully aggregate across time - can just sum, as seen above
  - Fourier Transform:
    if invariant, can estimate 1-period distribution and project distribution to generic horizon k steps into the future
  - invariant assumption is approx true for stocks, not true for bonds, and definitely not true for options

o Shelly Natenberg - Volatility Spreads Part 2
  - ATM theta decays faster, so long calendar spreads you want market to sit still
    - if market moves, gamma will move against you
    - you also want other people to think the market will move more - implied vol is good! more vega on longer term option
    - imagine CEO announcing statement next week - long calendar spread is good
    - upside down bird thing shape at expiry of the shorter term option
    - delta 0 gamma - theta + vega +
  - long call calendar spread has rho +, long put calendar spread has rho -
    - only time interest rates/rho matter
    - mattered more back in the early days
  - also dividends: opposite of interest rate, brings the price down - long call calendar spread dividend risk -
    - usually priced in, but if there is change announced, there is dividend risk
  - in conclusion, spread options are for future realized volatility vs. implied volatility
    - must look at IV for "value" - even if you think future realized vol is going up, you have to check that IV isn't overpriced
    - calendar spreads are a race between implied and realized volatility
    - what do the different spreads do?
      - whether risk/reward is open or closed
      - leverage, highest to lowest: strangles, straddles, ratio spreads, ladders, condors, butterflies, calendar spreads
    - usually want to remain delta neutral with vol trades, but can "let it ride"
      - in theory, adjust at regular time intervals, but most traders adjust when they reach a predetermined number of deltas
      - simplest way is to buy/sell underlying contracts (pure delta); also good because underlying is tighter bid-ask than options
        - however, can also use other options positions to hedge delta! but scary because you're altering your risk at same time
    - always ask, whenever new info comes, "does my position still make sense?"
      - the longer an options is held, the more important realized volatility becomes, the less important implied volatility becomes
        - if you hold all the way to expiry, IV no longer matters! all realized volatility
    - parties involved DON'T CARE about prices on legs of spread orders! but exchange must still report, so they make it up!
  - and finally, go out and try it! try it small! never be ashamed to do one of a strategy. then ask yourself why you made money

- Campbell and Company - Demystifying Roll Yield
  - decomp futures returns into 1) spot return and 2) roll yield
  - roll yield seems to be my "missing concept" - it describes the term structure and you use it along with spot return
  - define roll yield as "diff in return between a futures contract and its underlying asset"
  - misconceptions: roll yield is abstract and pointless; it creates arbitrage opportunity
    - eagerly await answers to these
  - for stocks, investor earns a dividend but pays a financing rate
  - note that when people declare SPX return, it is not touchable - people are touching through dividends and financing
    - HOWEVER, FUTURES POSITION DOES ACCOUNT FOR THESE - fully represents net benefit of owning the underlying stocks!
  - wow, financing costs are huge - consider S&P 1) spot return, 2) total return (dividends profits, not reinvested),
                                                 3) total return minus financing, 4) futures return
    - 3 and 4 should be exact same
    - assume dividends not reinvested because that would require buying additional shares
  *- futures are unfunded (except for margin); can calculate financing costs per unit of time as risk free rate * current dollar
    value of the constant-share S&P 500 spot position
     - for a fully funded position, financing cost can be viewed as opportunity cost of the investor’s capital
  *- note that people often define "return" as dollar, not %; literally ambiguous
  - commodities have "convenience yield"
  - roll yield = roll return = roll cost so for upward-sloping term structure negative
    - neg means financing costs more than dividends gain
    - it's a single number signal to show you basically what the term structure realized
      - and yes, Campbell uses it as to judge "momentum" or term structure for investing

o Michael to Nick Moore (Artemis)
  - recounts story of Wolverine going -1 at 0 and getting caught by 0 at 1
  - there is spread TAS apparently. hmmm
    - me: looks like 1/4 of TAS volume. didn't know that

. VIXTLT spikes
  x need to split calls and puts
  . need to calculate forward price, K_0, and pick out OTM options to track during the day, cut off 0 bids
  . need to automate code to read log files (once everything else is stable)
  . add intraday datetime handling to options_data_tools
  . add a OTM options filter to options_data_tools
  . may be a good idea to refactor add_forward() to contain a more straightforward unique-forward-for-group-expiry function
  x expand lookup_val_in_col() to work with "first strike less than forward"
  - new algo for finding consecutive 0-bids: do Boolean 0-bid, & with more OTM 0-bid to get Boolean consecutive 0-bid (works with NaN
    because NaN & True = False, so no false positives), then .idxmax() to find first True occurrence
*- note: calculation team is doing minutes weird - instead of rounding to nearest minute, they are rounding down, e.g.
         if there are 24 days, 4 hours, 59 minutes, 50 seconds, they do 24 days, 4 hours, 59 minutes instead of 24 days, 5 hours
  - Danny confirms this is consistent with VIX. so floor the minutes
  . do we have VIX-style filtering algorithm?
  . investigate no usable calls at 10:38am
  . go through exported price_progression CSV
- can't get .idxmax() on empty DataFrame btw (or .iloc[])
  - AHHH related I made a dumb mistake - if there is no consecutive 0 bid, idxmax shows the first index! dang it
x wait, apparently we also exclude any options with bid price 0...
- 2021-09-20 10:26am Next Term is a good example of forward dropping just under a strike and causing K_0 to change
  - in this case, no real effect on index! but probably because almost all weight is on near term 2021-10-15 expiry
- Near Term call 162.5 started being quoted at 10:20am! started off at 0.03@1.49, then at 10:38am went to 0.16@0.18
  - similar at call 168 and 169 - wide quotes tightened up at 10:30am

  . for own education, should look at S&P futures vs. SPY, Vanguard - what happens when futures actually track spot
  . do examples of hedging HYG: short HYG $1MM, how would I hedge this using futures
    . towards settlement day, does the hedge get worse?
  x margin requirements - why not on BBG?
    - Litch active threads + change active contract protocol
  . download: futures prices for SPX, SPY Vanguard and State Street ETFs, index, interest rates (1M Tbill, LIBOR, etc.), dividends
    . price the futures using usual spot formula
      - if we can get to fair price easily here, that's the difference from iBoxx is iBoxx spot not traded, can focus on that discrepancy
    . make sure time for each asset close is aligned
  - oil futures probably different because of storage cost which we can't isolate
  . take 3 separate months and hedge HYG through maturities
    - hedge ratio: $100MM notional, how many contracts?
       . need to know margin requirements
    . mark to market every day - P&L dollars every day
    . calculate P&L on settlement - what happens towards settlement each month?

  - day-to-day trading of funds?
  - we expected BlackRock to be more involved (Jennifer Schnabl did well) - we are having issues getting a coordinated effort
    across to customers
  - Litch: Dan Viner (macro credit trading) who would you go to to price high yield?
    A: Goldman, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Jane Street, BAML, etc.
    - Goldman do price it
    - JPM have ability to price it, but previous guy went to Citadel (Theo)
    - BAML are keen (Chad, Nico)
    - Barclays do HYG/LQD options - want to use futures to hedge
  - absolutely no idea why people aren't using futures to hedge, other than tech
    - different desk already trades VIX, so someone has the plumbing to trade CFE
  - Alex: how can I help?
    Michael: 1) banks - getting the message and doing setup on back of interested clients, even though it wasn't us convincing them;
                keep in touch with them on when they're getting set up
             2) MMs - different story - need to get into positions of convincing them they need it, and they don't want to hear it
                from Cboe (SIG, Jane, etc.);
                take the pulse by reaching out, let them know this is a priority
  - DealerWeb could become important part of ecosystem, basis market (currently not active) between futures and ETF
    - SocGen pricing ETF, then see on DealerWeb the basis of futures could be very helpful

. Paul McGeough call prep 2021-11-10
  . main topic: what's new with IBOR
    - "so to be clear, this means a behind-the-scenes data source is getting a strict upgrade from ABOR-only to being capable of IBOR?"
      - from updating data after-the-fact to updating in real-time?
    - "Aladdin will naturally get this new upgraded data source right?"
  . will they update the iShares website files after they complete IBOR/ABOR transition? ask McGeough
    - "will it propagate?"
    - "I know you guys don't like to acknowledge the iShares website holdings and cashflows files... but the thing is they would get
       us across the line the quickest"
  . talk about can they send us Aladdin number after IBOR/ABOR is done? with that, we can give up the chase on calculating ourselves
    - ideal is actually sending the accurate IBOR cashflows so we can load it and use live intraday prices to get "intraday" MD
      - but just having an Aladdin/Bloomberg/BlackRock official number or set of numbers is what we need
    - what if we got an Aladdin subscription? could you get us an FTP then?
  . did you see the latest email we sent to you and Krista and Steve? we attached a schematic and we want to set up a call for next steps

. talk to Ojas Desai about IBOR update
- Paul says Aladdin is the beginning and the end, the absolute truth
  - new IBOR stats should definitely propagate to the iShares website!
- Aladdin doesn't work like that - can't just "subscribe" to an MD, need to set up a whole environment with them
- Alex will replace Paul in the Krista and Steve thread

. Tiago call prep 2021-11-10
  . HYG NBBO data presumably from LiveVol - how do we get that?

. Arianne monthly write-up

. respond to Yoshiki on whether I'm going on Monday

. performance review in Workday by 2021-11-15

- figured out difference between Annapurna's router report vs. legacy:
  - legacy had "MPID" describing what we now know as "parent clearing firm"
  - Annapurna has "MPID" describing what we now know as "firm", formerly known in legacy as "on behalf"
  - we now have EFID classification - not in legacy
  - legacy had sub-account classification - no longer a thing
  - "affiliated firm name" is nothing more than a longform name for "firm"
  . so yeah, Annapurna's order router report needs 1) parent clearing firm info, 2) workflow speed optimizations

. pick 3 settlement days, look at IBOXHY, IBXXIBHY, HYG concentric circles' actual holdings
. use Dimitrios's code, do weighted percent holdings diff instead

. ask Michael: should I change Workday to print Indiana on my January W-2? submit new W-4?

. Pallavi dashboard - common notional amounts

- Jim Hill - BlackRock futures on ETF would be security, can Cboe get SEC exemption like on the VIX?
- IBXXIBHY not rebalanced daily because pushback from both BlackRock and Markit tech
- Jane and Flow in beginning, APs for ETF, pricing against each other
  - clearly pricing differently - ultimately went Flow's way we think, but not sure, Jane just left

o Salman Zaidi and Liz Perry (no show)
  - Salman: fixed income strategy team
    - FI ETFs, index construction, derivative substitute/complement
    - in relation to futures, they are the team putting ETFs in context of ecosystem (credit, CDX, etc.)
    - day-to-day analytics and convo with clients, talking through tracking error, fundamentals, relative value
    - pension funds, endowments, speak less to financial advisors for mom and pops
  - discussions on futures?
    - a few months ago: basic educational stuff - what do I need to know for these credit futures (total return-based? futures vs.
      ETF, nuances such as futures follow HYG index holdings not price, etc.), devolves quickly into liquidity discussion, then
      never hear back
    - before the liquidity question, it's "tell me more, I didn't know it exists"
    - btw, Salman does not chase to make sure there's actual transaction
  - we are chasing to improve liquidity (Alex Lynch), chasing to improve awareness but we don't have standing in credit of BlackRock
    - looking for ways to work through BlackRock
  - Salman used to work at Goldman, we give him Mason Fennelly, Grassi, Oliver Friedberg
  - Treasury futures you can make a voice quote, over a certain threshold, can make special price?
    - minimum block threshold for iBoxx is 50 contracts
  - from Oliver - speaking mostly to equity guys, not credit guys because they don't trade futures
    - Salman does not experience this - pension fund manages FI in-house do all execution just like Treasury futures
      - has never heard of anyone saying they can't set it up
  - what can we do to better equip you?
    - already fairly proactive - monthly commentary to sales team started 5-6 months ago
    - implied borrow from futures market, clients aren't sure - Salman wants to know if there are dealer insights
      - we say Oliver, Alex Igleski at Virtu, Jane Street had good handle imposing discipline but now no longer make markets
        after incentive program quid pro quo for them ran out (expect to get back in)
    - Goldman side: 1) Oliver, 2) European side, talking about doing roadshow centered around futures and trading credit through Goldman,
      3) execution side here, good 2-way dialogue with clients, but need something new to tell to clients

. spot check HYG vs. iBoxx - confirm difference between the 2
  . normal roll: 2021-09 (8/31, 9/1)
    x Israel and Singapore bonds have no CUSIP but have ISIN! Dimitrios should have been joining via ISIN
      - not a huge difference though $100MM difference in $20B, so 0.5% out of 2%+ notional difference
    - 2021-08-31: 63 FI bonds (+2 MM/cash) in HYG that are not found in IBXXIBHY
    - 2021-09-01: 25 FI bonds in HYG that are not found in IBXXIBHY
      - this is the date on which we can check things for things that didn't make IBXXIBHY
      x Intelsat went bankrupt in 2020-05-13 - check right before to verify this is the reason?
        - yup, exited IBHY as of 2020-06-01
      - Sirius had 2 bonds not in IBXXIBHY as of 8/31, and now they are in
      . Dish $15MM bond why not in? (not in next month either)
  . previous roll: 2021-08
    - CCO Holdings and Hess Midstream Operations don't have ISINs???
      - neither are in IBXXIBHY; latter is on Bloomberg
  . weird roll: 2020-07 (6/30, 7/1)
. bad data days: 2019-12-11, 2019-02-08, 2018-11-19
  . IBXXIBHY file issue, not HYG
. add to code: cash holding of ETF
  . is cash return literally the difference in return?
x after investigating, I have no idea why 2021-05 files cannot be read with UTF-8 encoding
  - 2021-05-03 file, 0.289280000000005,98.30[386...],4.568693993 (search it; spans 7 rows??) seems to be the issue???
- HY Broad index investigation
  . private placements are supposedly excluded from HY Broad, but Sensata made it??
  - can confirm defaulted bonds and bonds that trade flat leave HY Broad index
  - expected remaining life 1 year or 1.5 years
  - amount outstanding 200MM
  - country
  . really need to just ask Frantz for a walkthrough
  . pull full set and compare
. step 1: calculate cash every day
. step 2: take subset that no longer sums up to 1
  - what happens to weights?
  - Nan: 3 parts contributing to delta, 1) ones HYG trades but underlying index doesn't, 2) from weights distribution,
         3) premium vs. NAV
  . take out all stuff from HYG not in underlying index, renormalize returns (divide each of the returns by for example 0.9)
  - "what if fully invested" - total return of ETF price as "HYG return"

- conda config --set ssl_verify no
  - 2021-11-19 Pycharm wouldn't let me install package, running this in Git Bash fixed it

- Julie Hinchey's Confluence on DP Firm Tables
  - firms own 1) clearing arrangements and 2) port connections
    - majority of members are direct participants who own both
    - some members use a service bureau to connect to Cboe, i.e. own clearing arrangement but NOT the port it connects to
  - clearing arrangement is a database relationship associating clearing firm with trading firm;
    this relationship has an identifier - "MPID" in US Equities and "EFID" in US Options!
    - MPIDs are known throughout industry, EFIDs are a Cboe concept (analogue of equities terminology to options/futures)
  - Equities in our DB
    - field names with "MPID" are firm IDs
    - clearing arrangements (industry calls them MPIDs!) are named clearing_firm, clearing_symb, clearing_firm_symb
  - actual clearing is done through numbers which are not exchange-specific but are known to the DTCC
    - can get it from Clearing_firm table (we know this on Futures)
  - Agg ID - Cboe construct representing collection of member firms that are essentially same legal entity - e.g. WEXXWOLV
  - joining to MPID on "firm" table gets you the full length name
    - note that MPID on firm table is EQUIVALENT USAGE TO on_behalf_of, i.e. "firm, member"
    - note that EFID is to options/futures what MPID is to equities, except as terminology in some tables like "firm"
  *- CMTA (clearing member trade agreement)
    - investor can enter trades with a limited number of different brokers but later consolidate at EOD with only one broker for clearing
    - if this cmta field in order_fill is populated, it's the clearing firm, ignore the others
      - join to occ_id on clearing_firm, instead of using clearing_firm on order_fill

o Jump
  - invoices portal for charges
  - can they get a summary invoice everything aggregated to Jump
    - AKAM and Jump separately currently
  - can they get a machine-readable daily thing instead of what they currently get which has to be updated manually
    - month-to-date billing status report
      - upper and lower - upper tells rebate, lower can be used to back into
  - Jump takes 10% divided by tier status TPH volume, tells them 14.875% level, want to show that at a glance, machine-readable

x ping Alec at Virtu about why roll is suddenly -35 cents
  x send Teams meeting

x notify Arianne and Michael about partial Futures Trends

- Tuesday HYG trading at NAV, now big discount
  - Alec has intraday value (like Bloomberg), saw 30-40 cents, as extreme as it gets
  - Alec feels it is rare, they are still not sure what to do
  - HYG went back up, but there was a shock at beginning of the day
  - sticky when it gets out of whack
  - the more volume in futures, the quicker it'll go back, but it's sticking this month for sure
  - is it accurate to say premium/discount doesn't affect front month as much as back month? yes.
  - not confident they can take the size off, then not worth taking the risk and knocking price back to fair
  - Q: are you hedging with the ETF and carrying into maturity? or is that just risk for you?
    - A: ETF still scary because of premium/discount risk, will have to sell before
    - NAV trade is a possibility - agree to do it in the morning and then carry it into maturity
      - NAV trade market not so liquid, pretty manual, have to send out enquiries
        - if selling might not get bids that fit our fair value
      - purely bilateral, through chats

. put in Kaitlyn Meyer work order to convert spreadsheet into Tableau dashboard

. modified duration - how much would it have to move to make a difference in BP Treasury VIX?
. VIXTLT
  . ping Ojas, figure out timeframe
  . ping Alex, summarize what Paul said, ask were you able to get anything from Krista on how to get data in formal way? who
    is the right person to speak to about getting data if not Krista?
    - try doing this via Bloomberg, maybe email then green dot
    . reiterate that we want to start publishing ASAP, so need to get path, whether we should just make tweaks on our side and go instead
      of waiting
    . open to chat if she is up to speed
    - "Once you're ready and we know where Krista stands, we wanted to hop on a call to go over the "schematic" in the 
       last email we sent into that thread to figure out which threads to pull"

x prep to go through VIXTLT spikes with DerivStrat - clearly need to make changes before publishing, will need to go through Brian Eck

- Prep for Frantz Castor call to explain our ask for monthly HYG vs. IBXXIBHY cut holdings breakdown
  - background: as we mentioned in email, we're digging into pricing of the futures, which clearly has a dependency on HYG
    - however, futures and HYG do not return exactly the same - historically there has been some difference - like we've seen them
      diverge by 1% over 6 months back in late 2019
    - we are investigating whether the returns difference comes from the few holdings that are excluded from the futures index
    - we think it would be "worth it" to create this file that is available to market participants to lay it out plainly
      - they need to be able to trust that this difference in holdings is not responsible for the difference in returns,
        or, if it is responsible, it is openly available to reference and track
  - also ask about the preview files - maybe we had a misunderstanding on the email
    - we know we can't predict or preview what's in HYG at the end of the month, since they have discretion to do whatever
    - but preview files exist for the Broad index piece right?

o Tiago meeting about HYG NBBO
  - apparently the spreadsheet from 2019-03 used Oracle data, which had aggregated NBBO from every exchange; Oracle died in 2019-11 migration
  - Data Platform definitely doesn't have it
  - LiveVol probably has it
  > Tiago will dig up the TWAP code and the LiveVol code and hopefully we'll be able to piece it together
> follow-up ask Tiago about CHRStudio - once we set up, how to use?
  x then also ask about whether the ustf process failing hurts anything - is previous day's values retained in DICE for use again
    the next day if no new file is loaded in? if that's the case, we don't need to be alerted!
    . Tiago unsure - we can actually just test, now that we know Index Platform is still real-time for both % and bp versions

- Dennis says he has seen hiccups 10 days before the end of the month - apparently the tracking would go out of whack

x ask Michael about pre-2020-03 MMs, etc.
x monthly returns tracking error
x aggregate by days since rebalance, until rebalance
  x plot average and std (basically tracking error)

x fill out to modern day (resolve 9/30 data issue)

x show futures index vs. HYG underlying matches, so Cboe doesn't have to explain further
  x then show futures vs. HYG, way closer
    x show tracking between all the combinations
    . show one-day-a-month TRS futures vs. HYG
    - collect everything in PowerPoint
. ask Litch about BlackRock arb trade - does that answer their question
  - copy Yoshiki and Michael
  - A: messaged but he was occupied
x check term structure before/after 2020-03
. DV and Flow about 2020-03 change
  - does implied borrow even make sense?
  - A: Michael amenable, have not reached out yet
    - Flow has actually been out since 2021-10, and regardless are pretty tight-lipped, so not expecting much
. major futures contracts without tradeable underlying - do any of them do implied borrow?

x get PowerPoint and Excel themes from 400SL PC?

- Michael: does Flow pulling out have any effect?
. what about if we threw out all the days where time-weighted average spreads were terrible? IBHY-HYG would track better?
x schedule with Frantz for 2pm

x bug in run_iboxx_correlations: user shouldn't have to enter end date manually - it's 100% implied in the Bloomberg series what we want
  - having it be specified leads to issues - what if our "end date" doesn't generate the relevant "next" maturity
    e.g. end_date='2021-11-30', but 2021-11-30, 29, 28 all should have rolled in relation to unacknowledged maturity 2021-12-01

- Pycharm "reload from disk" now on F6 - no need to be scared because it is not destructive, at all! the bug is actually kind of like an added functionality

- Union adoption is ironically too good
  - they have expanded use but are netting long and short usage internally, so roll volume - specifically block - is less!
  x put in monthly report
x also put in monthly report that JP Morgan is in

x check with Tiago about NBBO vs. BBO (at Cboe) in VIXTLT
  x Neelesh would have the code
  . we can also spot check - find egregious quote and check NBBO in Data Platform
  - Michael: the way it used to be, they would have NBBO vs. Cboe BBO in same table
    x Tiago says this Oracle table no longer exists lmao
    . Tiago recommends check on BBG for NBBO if we know exact time
    - says DP does not have NBBO...
  . other thing to ask Tiago or Danny while we're at it - is there way in table to see individual quotes from multiple market participants?
    - we want to see who's making markets, to talk to them about how bad the quality is
    - Michael Shay or Omar would be able to get it, Michael can reach out to them

- Cboe Bitbucket remote changed from https://gzhang@stash.cboe.com/scm/mas/gaibo_modules.git to https://stash.cboe.com/scm/mas/gaibo_modules.git
  - updating to new style of remote (from clicking "clone" on website) fixed push and pull issues
  - separately, there was an issue with my personal remote:
    fatal: unable to access 'https://bitbucket.org/gaibo/gaibo_modules.git/': SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain
    - this can be avoided by doing git config http.sslVerify false
      - something is very wrong with Pycharm SSL stuff - also had to desable SSL to install packages

x square correlation and tracking error
  - put the table there ASAP, rest in appendix
  - add literal arrows, maybe with red and green arrows
x ask Litch do they care about daily tracking error or monthly - autocorrelation
  - walk through trade by trade the mechanism on what they care about - literally need to know the P&L
  - ask him all the MM questions - why the term structure change?
x do version of page 4 without 2020-03
  - care about not the good times
  x even after you remove, be ready to explain the bad dots
    x pick and explain
x SPY and SPX futures do same exercise as 7 and 8
x filter slide 8 term structure for maturity dates
. people will look at 7 and 8 and ask: can I expect it to continue to be flat? what drives the term structure of the futures?
  - talk to MMs for this:
- what's happened before and after 2020-03?
- what determines term structure? why is it negative recently?
- what's you view going forward of the dynamics?
x send Yoshiki steps and Litch summary
. we need to look at NAV, since we settle to NAV
  . we need some way to look at premium/discount to NAV, maybe in context of the roll

o Litch Call Notes
  - Winnike: started as they were looking at closeness, noted legit difference between index and HYG
  - short ETF, long futures, futures collapse to NAV
  - sec lending: fund is able to lend out the bonds, often fully offsetting management fee TER (usually not that much)
    - iShares may publish on website sec lending actually
    - tax adjustments also reflected
  - to avoid premium/discount of HYG, need to hedge with cash long cash short futures
  - people don't have clear arb, they are just talking about systematic overpricing
  - Florin Court day-trading on models vs. Union doing rebalances around month-end to hedge holdings
  - mark-to-market noise of long bonds vs. short ETF was terrible, slightly better with futures since they mark to NAV
  - Litch agrees about clients being long
  - incentive program paid for 12 cents wide and roll markets - previously weren't incentivized to trade roll market
    - roll market wild west
    - more MMs fighting over it - before if they knew a client needed to roll, they would price badly
    - user position affecting term structure, clients now will smash it down
  - whipsawing of premium discount will remain important
    - beautiful way to show prem/disc vs. roll market - good supplement to term structure chart?
    - price sensitivity to prem/disc - could be a Greek
  - Litch sending data about positioning
  - client to client, client to liquidity provider, liq prov to liq prov
    - prior to May negligible, 29 in May, 69... 120s now

. send email to Frantz about misunderstanding

- IBHY Oct to Nov difference: ADM 988200CA, Morgan Stanley CRRV1H-BARC, JP Morgan 75400E did way more last month, Goldman C0796531 (Union) rolling much less because of internal offsetting

- ProShares used to do everything through RBC Hans Nelson until 2018, when margins really increased like 50% overnight
  - had to put up more margin than they had cash in funds
  - RBC won't give them any margins? Cboe talked to them but RBC said no, and ProShares started using return swaps and multiple firms
  - technically ProShares could do things through EDF but also have it go through RBC if they wanted (?)
    - "give-up agreements" - execute in these products elsewhere, but we (RBC) accept risk of the trade
      - this is CMTA - automatic in this field, or EDF can manually go through OCC Encore system (called a put-out) to RBC who then manually accepts
      - most big firms have give-up agreements in place; they don't necessarily like to do it, but big customers will ask for this
        - "hey Goldman you guys have the bigger footprint in this space, but we want to clear through Morgan Stanley they have the rest of our stuff"
  - 2021-11 EDF could have just said we can't anymore

. what would make modified duration change significantly?
  . check Fed announcement days?
  - what if on settlement date, and there's a product, we get no file
  . big creation/redemption days - how much does that affect?

. need to check premium/discount vs. front month and second month near maturity
  - surely HYG continues to swing but front month stabilizes??

x 4/1/2016, 3/1/2016, 2020-05, 06, 2020-12, 2020-03, 2013-06, 07, 10
x 2020-03-13, 2020-03-20, 2018-11-26, 2018-12-04, 2018-11-23, 2020-04-09, 1, 2020-03-24, 2020-03-12, 9, 18, 16, 30, 2018-12-03
x do version of HYG vs. Futures
> do version of Futures vs. Futures Index, makes more sense
x monthly like average or median aggregation of futures term structure
  x can leave daily, add rolling 1 month median or something

o Tiago session
  - miraculous moment: I started the old hourly Bloomberg-dependent BP TYVIX code and we watched VIXZN started ticking on Index Platform
    (http://c-nii19.us.cboe.net:8888/?#/) 13 minutes after the hour
  - should ask Neelesh why price percentage index is dead though
  > didn't have chance to revisit LiveVol NBBO for HYG yet, follow-up in next two days
  > ping him when I get CHRStudio access restored

x message Neelesh about 2 things
  x simple confirm: is VIXTLT still NBBO, as according to Jira ticket? reason for checking is that we see some pretty terrible quotes - if we can confirm,
    then we can focus on the market makers as the problem
    - yup, NBBO
  x why is VIXZNP dead? on Index Platform, it does not tick - it should be ticking internally as long as we get CME Treasury Options prices?
    > need to chase down "expirationdates.csv" - ask Tiago or Rebecca apparently? I forgot Tiago was creating this file for percentage VIX...
      - location of the file: /vic/ICIFiles/expirationdates.csv   (edeepfrzp/d)

- deleting 2018-09-27 terrible futures return actually changes HYG-futures correlation from 0.97 to 0.98 nice
  - similarly, deleting 2013-02-01 return removes an outlier for IBOXHY-IBXXIBHY correlation

. reach out to MMs and BlackRock for call?
. put in holiday hours
x measure air conditioner dimensions
x check number of faucets
x order Jim things

- TAC meeting prep
  - hi guys I'm Gaibo from the Cboe, I work for Michael Mollet in Futures, so just gonna quickly go through CFE volume
  - context for VIX for the past two months: September big SPX decrease most of month, huge drawdown after a year of big SPX growth, 240k
    October, also interesting, big SPX recovery after September drop, 200k
    November, also interesting, huge volume days in final 3 days of the month (continuing into December), around Omicron, inflation, hawkish Fed - big volume days around 400k, ADV 225k
  - in context of this, we can look at YTD ADV for VIX of 203k - an average of basically alternating months of 180k and 240k
    we can compare to ADV from this month last year, but any comparison to post-COVID months volumes is just going to look good, because ADV stayed at around 150k finishing out that year
  - looking at quarterly, so far, Q4 on track to be slightly above Q3, which was slightly above Q2, all of which are substantially below Q1's 240k from the Reddit retail volatility 
  - mini-VIX at its core follows big VIX, but overall ADV that we see has sort of stayed constant or even dipped below what it was last year as market makers
    reduce their proportion of volume - you can see YTD ADV is around this month's 11k, last month's 8k was the lowest we've seen, for reference
  - IBHY dropped off in recent months

o TAC meeting
  - Drew Smyth (DV aka Lupo) and John Buatti (CTC) and another guy Henry Liu (SIG) all say Weeklys version of mid-curve options would be extremely helpful to Weeklys which currently don't
    trade because the futures are so wide
    - like 4 people chimed in on this, seems promising
  - Adam Kelly: ErisX vision: growing regulatory dialogue globally, stability issues, fragmentation of liquidity AND data, transparency will gravitate towards traditional markets
    - digital asset initiatives will turn ErisX into Cboe Digital
  - Mike Dennis (ABN) feedback: VIX has been Cboe's legacy, ErisX digital transition sounds really cool and ambitious, don't gloss over it
    - JB also likes ErisX, asks is there a product roadmap so everyone can participate to share opinion and optimize specs (like with Weekly mid-curve)
  - Modernization of Derivatives Tax Act

o Brett Johnson - VIXTLT Tradeable Settlement
  - in the past, MM liquidity not great
    - TLT may be different (we know it's not)
  - "tradeable settlement" - can trade strip of options such that each of those series would trade at Cboe's index's opening print
    - every options price that is touchable is incorporated into the SOQ
  - what about market orders? very aggressively priced limits - MMs use both market and limit
  - Brett: how do we get consensus? consider extremes (from his invitation)
  - TWAP is technically tradeable as well, unless you are underaggressive or there's not sufficient liquidity for everyone
  - if I saw opening print 18.20 and I could get that price or better, I wouldn't care
    - if weighted average 18.14
  - John Hiatt: we shouldn't do VIX method at all - lesser VIXs we've seen it very different from SPX, so much deviation in the rest of the day, it doesn't matter it's so distorted
  - Brett: non-tradeable settlement easier, but also we don't have it coded
    - either way, we're going to be all in to develop an extensible framework
  - tradeable, we have this pre-open from 7:30am-8:30; non-tradeable, we would watch 8:30am TWAP
  . need to talk to market participants on which they want
    - V2X in EU is tradeable, getting "distorted" (quote from the shitty professor arguing for manipulation)
  - John: if spread width requirements very wide, changing bids that don't even get hit will change the midpoint 10% and change the VIX 10%, bad
    - Brett: can we overweight trades over quotes? seems like it would be hard to replicate via trade anyway
  - John: PM settlement may be better, average near close on TLT options?
  - smoothing algo, having intra-day settlement, both would throw out the window the idea of tradeable prices
  - apparently John is picking SPX strike ranges - since when?

. Tiago next meeting prep
  . need to chase down "expirationdates.csv" - ask Tiago or Rebecca apparently? I forgot Tiago was creating this file for percentage VIX...
    - location of the file: /vic/ICIFiles/expirationdates.csv   (edeepfrzp/d)
  . CHRStudio access restored - how to use?
  . didn't have chance to revisit LiveVol NBBO for HYG yet, follow-up in next two days
  . what happens when no file?

o Michael iBoxx Incentive Program
  - incentive program is purely to increase volume, everything else is goal but not directly related to the incentive changes
  - ideal world more size on bid and offer screen
  - 3rd and 4th month/quarterlies must be driven by customers asking MMs
  - issue is our program is not rich enough to incentivize everything we want - with our $125k we want to focus solely on ADV
  - note: v1 was 2018-09, version for 2020-03, then version for 2021, now we're doing version for 2022
  - make sure strikethroughs are on 2021 version
  - btw FOI act industry standard is to not say how much they're being paid for it

- Litch: Winnike had TRS on the index, but most of industry (confirmed by Franz) is shifting to doing TRS on the ETF
- IMM (international monetary market) days are Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec third Wednesday (15-21), on which EuroDollar and FX futures/options expire
  - CDS also aligned closely, with Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec 20 prior to 2015-12, at which point it is now Mar and Sep

o Henry Liu
  - people want to trade something volatile
    - options that expire every week but deliver nearest month futures
  - currently difficult to provide liquidity because of risk of settlement and no SPX options at non-standard expirations
    - concept of Weeklys occurs in every product, but tough to source liquidity from underlying here
  - VIX can't get liquidity until regular monthly becomes front week
  - demand for short-dated options, especially tied to liquid underlying to get out of delta part
    - no chance for retail in VIX right now - they would go straight to VXX
  - Michael: if retail can trade an SPX option, they can do big VIX
  - settlement perspective, what would Henry like for weeklies that settle to monthly
    - physical, PM, auto-ex Friday 4pm VWAP
    - Michael: are futures liquid enough to resist price being pushed around?
      - Henry: equities has this issue every day, it should be fine, maybe have both VWAP and mid
    - this would be a completely separate product from normal Weeklys

o Yoshiki 2021-12-22
  . slides: edit dot colors, edit median line colors
    . add info on recent roll pricing volatility to ask question on HYG premium/discount vs. futures price
  . make spreadsheet of HYG price, HYG NAV, futures price, futures index going into settlement when there is significant HYG p/d from NAV
  - MM conversations narrative:
    - 2020-03: what happened? presumably stemming from incentive program
    - HYG vs. futures - they correlate extremely well, how are MMs pricing?
    - roll pricing towards maturity - how does it depend on premium/discount?

. ask what issue is with BMO - we know the names of the guys, but don't have contact?
. make renewed push for Litch (iBoxx customers) and Parth (VIX traders) bespoke info into Salesforce into Data Platform
  . link up with Charlie and ask what format the info would need to be entered
    . offer to format it myself, see what Litch and Parth think

#### 2022-01-03

- CAREISAM (like CAREBEN) is operated by Oscar Sumpter (eETD of SocGen) (electronic exchange traded derivatives)
  - CAREBEN says Burke Corcoran, don't know if that's a person or two
  - generally can't glean much from operator IDs - it's the guy executing, though sometimes if firm is using a rented port, may reveal actual firm trader

- scratch_2.py last edited 2021-02-26 2:14am
  - I remember now - previously fixed up this file to export to PrdDevSharedDB/New Treasury VIX/Historical TLT MD/ for Pallavi
    - had a pretty sophisticated system to check against previous exports to make sure things were consistent

- goddamn it, at some point, BlackRock modified their .xls files to have Disclaimer sheet AND changed columns in Historical (which I used!)
  - 5 columns used to be As Of, Index Level, NAV per Share, Ex-Dividends, Shares Outstanding
  - now they've removed Index Level, so it's only 4 columns!
    - this screwed up my makeshift search string to find Historical sheet lmao
  - FYI, Disclaimer did not happen at same time as Historical columns change
    - Historical change was between as of dates 2021-09-29 and 2021-09-30, though on that last file 2021-09-29, Historical Index Level's 9/29 and 9/28
      both had -- instead of numerical level, so last valid Index Level was 2021-09-27

x woah what in the hell - 2020-02-14 - coupon cashflows off by 0.001 on 4 days in 2038-2040... how???
  - well at least we know this wasn't introduced by the implied cash date correction - it existed before, magnitude just got covered up
  x could it be a rounding error on BlackRock's part?
    - A: ah yup! it is 0.0005 rounding to 0.001 for me, specifically BlackRock 1048013.363 and me 1048013.3624999999
      - if I do a hacky double rounding - .round(4) to make sure there are no repeating decimals, then a .round(3), I might eliminate this issue
        - but I may introduce an edge case... maybe just don't touch it
        x what about a .round(11) or something? that works I believe!

- TLT's bigger MD changes happen quarterly; this is because 30-year issues only quarterly 2, 5, 8, 11 mid-month
x show this to Alex Lynch - she was on interest rate desk, will appreciate this MD volatility if we don't get the files
  - "we can't just default to yesterday's MD - it's a 1% difference"
  - "so we need up-to-date, timely info from BlackRock on MD"

x ping Ojas, bring it up with Alex Lynch

x investigate spikes in term structure chart - what happened to prices after 2020-04-13
x adjust to grid and beginning of month
. fix up appendix narrative and captions
  - MMs receive Markit stuff, can independently verify even though we can't send the files

. marry Litch 2 emails + his slides + our slides
. reframe monthly Arianne write-up away from just the numbers - need to automate the following
  . track realized vol - 1, 5, 21 day basis
    - e.g. December middle of month realized vol collapses with holidays, obviously VIX volumes are gone
    - think of ways to quantify this
  . daily range - very tangible! more high-low range gets more attention and volume
    . of both VIX and SPX
  . shape of term structure - static means low volume
    - e.g. 80% of the time when you see this term structure, volume is down for next month, etc.
  . number of participants info - get Litch Book 4
  . AUM for ETFs - get Parth Book lol
  . SPX options - we're talking about us being under budget, surely CME is dealing with something similar
    - SPX futures, options, VIX options, etc.
  . VIX has high correlation to CORRELATION - when things are in unison, you get strong S&P vol; ICJ, CORR3M, dispersion
    - single-name space is inversely related to S&P/VIX
  . Hemal may have more recs, talk to him about "why VIX futures volumes are doing what they're doing"
    . same with Hiatt
  . options combo, ECRP, blocks - explain futures from delta of options
  . Murphy's Market Musings (SIG) uses SPX # of 2/3 std dev moves in a year (compared to # expected)

. contact Alec about slides once they're ready
x DV: Walter does the trading, Zeke did the talking last time with lots of opinions

x mid-curve weeklys as proposed by Henry Liu (SIG) existed at one point as "BOW" (on front month, base ticker symbol)
  - John: there's even less use of it than the current VIX Weeklys
  - this was around 2014-2015; maybe even 2009-2013 lmao
    - Henry Liu started in late 2014
    - 2009-2013 is when Weeklys started for SPX, then for single stocks
      - Henry thinks the world was just worse at pricing then, things could be different this time around
  - John: need frank discussion on why things work and why things don't. surprising Henry says that there is demand on current weekly options, and it seems
          it suffers from pricing because weekly futures isn't very liquid. how is that the case, do you need two-sided volumes?
  - Henry: 1) there are people quoting weeklys pretty tight, but often not available; 10k-50k deltas; right now, if you're trading 100 options, you just can't
           get your deltas because of the futures; 2) currently very OTM customers in weeklys; if you get to 50 delta, market is nonexistent; not enough
           liquidity to replicate in SPX, especially when it actually matters
    - if it's a customer who calls, Henry might be able to do, but if Lakeshore calls, he says I can't do it
  - John: can we ever get to the ideal?
  - Henry: best we can get to is VIX ecosystem liquidity prior to VXX
  - Susquehana 10up 20 cents wide generally back in the day, no opportunities to tighten up if no order flow
    - variance replication just doesn't facilitate tighter markets, in absence of VXX
  - you can argue it's correlated to something else, but inevitably that breaks down. and people trade VIX literally for those edge case breakdowns
  - current mid-curve plan: options out to front 6 month VIX futures expiries, expect Jan Feb options trading for Mar futures, Jan options on Feb futures
    - Wednesday morning expiries (not Friday) so you can trade them relative to each other
    - proposed physical settlement, not sure yet though (Henry agrees; no opening auction right after, hard to replace deltas in cash settle)
    - Henry: equities 4pm-5:30pm time to decide exercise, if no grace period on open, you might have a lot of weird activity at settlement
      - uh oh, sudden swing with auto-exercise would be scary
      - John: VWAP maybe
    - John: what we see is vol funds needing to match an objective, need to cater
  - SLUs?

o Alex
  - Chris Morris for VIXTLT! will reach out, talk to him instead of Ojas presumably
  - Rachel Underhill

- 2021-02-02 is earliest we get QRM/GIP data on IBHY, as of 2022-01-05
- IBHY 2020-04-13 - very little trading, presumably wide markets
- IBHY 2021-09-30 - wide markets in expiring contract near maturity date - we should exclude!
  - this causes mid settle prices to be "off" and term structure to be steeper than usual	

. I should make a single-day trade/quote price loader on Tableau
  - need to distinguish contract months

x cut the left tail to May 2019 or something

o Yoshiki MM convo prep
  x we know 2020-03 was when volumes started pumping - prior to that, volumes were nonexistent without the incentive program
    - knowing that, DV almost certainly won't be able to say why the term structure changed... did MMs prior just keep 2nd month price high?
  > another thing though, 2020-03 doesn't disrupt front month correlation with HYG - what's the explanation, can we say something about 2nd month?
    - A: took a look at 2nd month, doesn't say much...
    > if 2020 bumped volumes but kept 100% correlation with HYG, why is this so different in 2021? what's happened?
----
- slides narrative:
  - slide 1: reference for futures vs. HYG; underlying indexes correlate perfectly, corresponding tradeable products correlate almost perfectly; note that in the
             first place, HYG doesn't correlate well with index; explain tracking error is std of diff in returns
  - slide 2: futures track HYG extremely closely on daily basis - outlier points are all accounted-for in 2 market events
  - slide 3: 
----
  - MM conversations narrative:
    - HYG vs. futures - they correlate extremely well, how are MMs pricing?
      - we can do pretty well if we know previous day's price, but how do you get initial price?
      *- we have to explain what they need from us: what's the carrot (or stick) for why MMs should share information with us (ask Danny and Michael)
         - to what extent do DV care about development of the product?
        - either way, basically logic is we know customers, MMs don't, customers need questions answered/alleviated
      - exactly how much are they incentivized? DV vs. others
    - 2020-03: what happened? presumably stemming from incentive program
    - roll pricing towards maturity - how does it depend on premium/discount?
----
- explain why we want to know
- explain why they should help us
- ask for high level explanation of pricing
  - general explanation of term structure: what drives it? what drives correlation between futures and HYG... why does it break down sometimes?
- ask about borrow rate - does that come into play?
- ask about p/d - is there a direct mechanism by which that affects pricing?
- then drill into, but wait that doesn't exactly explain this empirical data

- narrative while going through the slides is
  "clients made these observations, we're both incentivized to answer, so at the end let's talk mechanism of pricing especially centered around these empirical observations"
----

- Prep for MM conversations

- 3:30pm on 10th
- 3:30pm or 4pm on 11th
- 3:30pm or 4pm on 14th

- DV: small firm, high frequency
  - interesting pricing situation: DV Capital gives these traders capital, so they are constrained
    - on one hand, cannot necessarily offset futures with cash bonds
    - on other hand, cannot compete with established MMs entrenched in HYG
  - futures lets them get edge in a space where they otherwise would be competing with established MMs in HYG, while also not being able to replicate in cash bonds
  - they now do trade some cash bonds apparently, but still limited by capital
  - Zeke, head guy, very talkative in general, Michael has decent personal relationship
    - Zeke actually borrows from DV Capital to trade; Zeke trades VIX under Charlesworth Research because VIX is less capital intensive
  - Walter was less talkative last time, may have just been deferring to Zeke
  - Dan DeRose (Danny Jisa knew well) also doing umbrella relationship with DV
    - got hurt badly by Sep-Oct roll 30 cents over to 30 cents under lol, which is why we now only see one DV account trading!
  *- MMs scratching against each other is kind of zero-sum, customers provide the edge, that's why all MMs should care
- Prime: similar to DV, been in longer than DV, already do it in Treasuries, futures gives them a leg up against entrenched market participants doing HYG
- Flow: plays close to vest, not even forthcoming to BlackRock
- Virtu: 

. question: why does pricing go super wide right before maturity?
. question: if futures trading at premium/discount, why couldn't they just hold it into futures maturity?

. slide 4: update the stats!
. slide 5: prep for questions on why cumret is no longer stable in 2021 - must ask MMs
- Prime and DV do the same thing, may not be trading with each other; both clang into Mercury, Mercury are like a catalyst among MMs
- keep in mind these high frequency guys, especially DV, are very scared of people knowing more than them - quick to run away
  - they can't afford to use HYG or cash bonds to hedge!
- people took advantage of spreads being cheap early in month and closing higher - got hurt bad in V1X1 in 2021-09-28 when spreads went from 0.1 to -0.5!
  - Dan DeRose of DV blew out, BMO hurt

o Danny on DV incentives
  - traders love to have close relationship with exchange
  . data we can give DV?
    - anything on reactions to pricing, relative pricing
    - can give them brief info on customer growth to open

---- Planning DV call and run-throughs

. don't forget to update charts
. don't forget you care about pricing; you should not be asking subquestions about correlation, term structure inversion, etc.

. ask Michael to open with an update on volumes or something
. start in by saying I'm an analyst working for Michael, my role is to look at data and answer questions to prospective customers,
  and one of the biggest questions for iBoxx futures is around pricing
. we've put together this deck around empirical observations in IBHY futures pricing, and we hope to discuss them to get a better
  understanding of the pricing ourselves
  . our ability to answer customers' concerns on pricing translates to more volume in the product and hopefully more edge for you
    because that will be customer volume, instead of MMs bumping around
*sound excited*

. why is this not trivial? compare these futures to S&P - where it's dead simple. the underlying here is not traded - that's where the questions arise
  - the observation that we can make is correlation to HYG
Index designed to track underlying index of HYG
HYG doesn’t closely track its underlying index
HYG price trades at premium/discount to its NAV
IBHY Futures’ underlying is not tradeable, but we observe very high correlation with HYG, but IBHY Futures settles to index NAV

*overview slides*

*stop screensharing*

. so naively, that's why we think HYG is what's pricing futures, have prev day can deduce next day, but it doesn't explain
  1) when contract is first listed how to price,
  and 2) it doesn't explain what has happened in 2021 when correlations broke down contrary to 2020,
  and 3) also, towards expiration, since it converges to something that's not HYG, how do you deal with that?
  - I've got a couple more slides on term structure specifically, but before that, we don't want the secret sauce
  - can you guys shed some light on this, pricing with respect HYG?
. if confirm HYG, ask about how to price in the beginning? how to price 2nd month? borrow rate?
  how did 2021 correlation breakdown affect this?

- ideally at this point, we know enough to walk through the term structure ourselves, explaining the inversion
. observation on the term structure
. okay so most recent months, is THIS what has happened to make the inversion?
  . alt: but then how are you pricing 2nd month from 1st month?
. offer 2020-03 explanation, ask about dynamics?
  . was it just mispriced before? presumably you guys looked at that before coming in, what happened?
. we're not asking for the secret sauce, but how does the term structure work, and how does it work going into the maturity?
. premium/discount could really muddle things, be careful introducing that...
  . "could this have anything to do with it?" between 5 and 6?
. even understanding of why futures track HYG is hand-wavy, ask explicitly about the mechanism

x send Yoshiki invite for Sunday night
x figure out speaking roles for Michael (maybe positive spin on customer volumes, initiatives; don't frame purpose of the meeting) and Danny (maybe nothing)

- Krag 2016 VIX and SPX notes
  - market positioning from: level of IV, term structure of IV, put/call skew, volumes
    - IV level relative to history
    - term structure usually upward sloping and smooth; kinks may indicate excess demand; checkmark implies pricing heightened near-term risk
    - skew - demand for downside puts; high skew on high option volume means market worried about upcoming event
      - skew usually (25 delta put - 25 delta call)/50 delta IV for given term (vol difference between puts and calls after controlling for level of IV)
  - "strike risk" of SPX - index rallies and you need to roll strikes upward to maintain delta hedge of SPX puts
    - VIX 20-25 are always in play!
  - basis risk when using VIX - payout not certain from VIX options when SPX bleeds down -5% on low realized vol

x email Yoshiki summary
  - DV gives impression they think they know what they are doing in theory, not doing it in practice, and even then we think their theory is not valid
  - yikes

x make sure Ojas email reaches him after being sent via BlackRock securemail
  - OMG since 2021-11-16, cashflow files have been good!
  - holdings files are still bad, but cashflows are usable! WOOOOO

x post-mortem on what not to do on the call

- hmmm. IBXXIBHY correlating to IBOXHY means literally the only reason HYG and futures don't match their respective indexes is that the holdings change over the course
  of the month!
  - it's all about the intramonth change - it matters!

. look at intraday data for who starts quoting the contract first
. Prime or Flow next, and Virtu? Flow might have more insight on HYG
x message Litch about slide version of pdf slides
x Rachel Underhill - offer call to go over context and why daily MD matters

- describe moves as # of stds
- use VVIX a lot more
- can we leverage intraday volatility? e.g. 2022-01 NDX close not volatile but intraday it is very volatile!
  - usually we do close-to-close volatility over 21 business days, annualized
  - would intraday be 5 minute volatility over the trading day, annualized? does anything make more sense than 5 minutes?

o ABC Arb, with Sarj
  - Michael: VIX quoting is tight because of flow, not fundamental SPX arb; monthly standard expirations are helped by ETPs
  - mid-curve options, including new weeklies
  - Adeline agrees, it's hard to hedge deltas in the weeklies right now
    - Michael mentions Henry Liu said same thing, especially away from the money
  - what do we see right now? deep OTM volume recently - hard to explain with Omicron, Fed, inflation, very different from a few years ago when short vol was normal goal

. revive Frantz Castor email thread

. prep for Yoshiki call, including digging back into the math

x Litch slides - merge them 1st draft for Tuesday call

. finish futures monthly outside of VIX

- Michael and Hiatt talked to Optiver out of Amsterdam, they like VXST 9-day VIX, previously had futures 6-7 years, Spot Trading (now out of business) was market maker
  - short-dated vol is Optiver's specialty
  - Michael and John don't like the idea, weeklies are rarely quoted inside 20 cents even, can't get enough done to tighten bid-ask
    - even nickel tick in standard futures is heavily dependent on ETPs to bring in Jump, etc.
    - our argument is you're not paying 20 cents to cross the market, you're making a play that VIX is going from 20 to 25
  - Optiver understand, mention they want to see 10-15 cent bid-ask on 9-day VIX; we don't think that's happening
  - Henry Liu's thing on weekly mid-curves is probably closest to working - Michael and John are doubling down on doing that one instead
    - would be late Q1 of 2023, given OOF isn't even coming until late 2022
    - need to solicit interest on this product first

. VIX - we need to account for customer volume being skewed by ProShares numbers (really high beginning of 2021)

. create realized vol dashboard
. investigate intraday DP data source

- we don't have 2021-11-30 Markit SFTP files for IBHY - it didn't come through or something

x how do you arrive at capped notional value (i.e. how to do capping)? and notional value before that?
  - capping is a complicated iterative process of determining offending group and either 1) cutting group's amount outstanding and giving to other groups
    (pro rata capping) or 2) draining away its smallest bond's weight (step-wise weight reduction)
  . worth asking "how is the notional capped?"
  - very unclear which one IBXXIBHY does and WHY!
- "cash" in index is exclusively coupon payment btw; dirty price (with accrued interest) is what's used to get "market value"
- so to get market value and cash value each day, use capped notional/100 to get units, do market value = units*dirty price (bid price+accrued), cash = units*coupon

- 2 revelations about iBoxx:
  1) I've been thinking about futures index rebalance wrong
  2) we can use the preview files

x tell Michael about why futures index doesn't track HYG
  - so Markit said we don't want last day of the month to be settlement because they're literally too busy lmao
  - OMG: futures can close out open interest before the settle, making it so that no one is hurt by bad settle
    - so technically this product can track HYG every day except for settlement, have a stupid collapse on settlement, but everyone's okay with it
      because customers have all rolled and MMs have closed out with each other
      - issue only arrises when a customer decides to hold to settle - with this product, literally no one should want that lol

x in my dream: must consider that each day is a TR from base value applied to last month's final index value; NO CUMULATIVE movement
  - but all the movement is still of the wrong month... and then it accumulates to current month, so point still stands

. troubleshoot mute issue over course of several calls with Michael

o Yoshiki
  - friction, almost impossible to get OTC bonds
  - bonds discount is yields, don't need to worry about price because physical delivery
  - HYG NAV vs. HYG index?
    - probably doesn't pan out because HYG changes
  - 11am-3pm Chicago time any day next week
  . try HYG prem/disc on futures with naive formula

o Bank-oriented iBoxx slides
----
x Litch futures index vs. CDX HY credit % components difference - add to slide 3
x update margin numbers, bold them
  > could make into automated download from Cboe website
x narrative for slide 7: highlight that futures tracks HYG as a positive
  - make sure it's daily tracking error, add that to slide
x make everything consistent with dates
x probably ultimately take out slide 9
x move slide 10 to just under Venn diagram
- investigate July why more holdings came in
- add Alex Lynch email and banks email content; is prior too focused on customers rather than banks?
x goal for bank: there were definitely bank customers who weren't satisfied with just TRS and ETF - make them think about those guys and their PAIN POINTS
x add title to Beta
x look at S&P tracking error as reference
  - E-mini to SPY is like 3.1% daily annualized
x add futures return annualized to slide 10
  - add the stuff hinting at futures term structure
x add term structure slide
. investigate 2020-04-13 quotes - how do you pull quotes?
  . need to learn DP finally lol
. investigate 2020-07 HYG holdings - why so much cash, why so many more holdings??
x text slide will be useful there - address MMs, incentive program, hypotheses
x add "Markit intends to move to hourly, Q2 2022", both indexes we think
- think bank version, customer version; customer version would have CDX in the body, bank version cut even from appendix maybe
  - CDX market is huge, banks would feel threatened by us "targeting" CDX with slides
  - "what is the common benchmark people use" it's the Bloomberg Barclays (JNK, basically) or ICE BofA - do CDX vs. that and futures vs. that
  - lmao we should be targeting marketing at JNK (SPDR, Bloomberg) users
. do correlation matrix in run_iboxx_correlations.py???
  . then we can do more with CDX instead of futures-CDX correlation
----

- Manning and Napier, Raffeisen was scared off by JPM not quoting

x send follow-up to Alex Lynch about exactly what we want

- new hires on Workday: r-1855, All of Workday
  . go through by tomorrow afternoon
  - projects: visuals/reports on VIX, summaries of revenue (D&A->D&A Management->Cboe Top Firms by Revenue->Average Daily Revenue)
  - overqualified for summer intern -> ask them to become school-year interns

x missing Markit files on:
  HY: 2019-09-02, 2021-03-05, 2021-04-02, 2021-04-22, 2021-05-31, 2021-07-02, 2021-07-05, 2021-09-06, 2021-11-10, 2021-11-25, 2021-11-30, 2021-12-24, 2022-01-17
  IG: (Indices only: 2021-11-26) same as HY
  - besides those, we have every file for indexes from 2018-05-30 to present
  . WIP!

. go into Tableau and do a refresher
  - for some bizarre reason, data sources not sorting, so really hard to get to US Futures data sources lmao I want to find Annapurna's thing
  . finish new version of historical volume breakdown with better naming based on Julie Hinchey's guide
  - dig into history for what other dashboards I wanted to finish, such as Litch's thing about spread data
  . adding notional linked to firm (in CFE Activity Dashboard) would be pretty cool - useful for Singapore lmao
    - need to split by contract lmao

x message Danny Jisa first thing in the morning for Thursday?

- map underlying of future like bond, need model to calculate risk

- Goldman guy saying he doesn't consider difference between futures and HYG
- Danny Jisa calls with MMs - they care about Treasuries, Prime getting dinged on Bitcoin, a "grab bag of shit" used to price; Michael thinks it should be primarily HYG
- Group One insisted on pricing VIX Options with VIX Futures as underlying, even though in theory it should be Spot VIX

- Fed put is a protective put - finally understand lol

- Chris Murphy, 2022-01-25: It is hard to tell when the selling will abate, but the typical indicators are all flashing:
  VIX, SPX and NDX term structure inversions,
  RSI’s the lowest since Covid,
  put call ratios the highest since May 2020 (OPCVTPCR Index),
  VVIX/VIX spiking,
  VXN and VIX finally spiking above early Dec levels to make ~9 month highs,
  AAII bull/bear at Covid lows,
  NDX worst weekly performance since March 2020,
  etc.
  - HYG puts are very active early on, with over 200k contracts on the tape, well above already elevated recent average pace
  - realized vol doesn't capture intra-day implied vol moves! realized vol will not tell the full story this month 2022-01
- 2022-01-24 SIG Daily: SPY June 498/500 call spread is like a binary option, price being ~15% likelihood because 500 is max $2 and price was $0.30, divide
- Murphy: "top 20 (#17) peak from the past 10 year (we use 30 day non-overlapping peaks to avoid double counting, so it wouldn’t be a confirmed peak until next month)"
  - non-overlapping "peaks" - interesting concept

. Goldman has a low-to-close indicator - could be a cool dashboard

- think about what to ask interviewers:
  1) can you describe a Python or Tableau project that's fresh in your mind?
    - what's the thought process, from start to finish - how did you approach the problem, and how did you execute?
    - how do you do data visualization?
  2) kind of forward, but can you literally pull up some code/dashboard that you most recently worked on and spend a couple minutes walking me through it?
  3) how would you solve *this* problem in Tableau/Python?

o Thomas Chippas, ErisX, FCM discussion
  - GMI, FIS? something about clearing

o RJO FIG John Coleman
  - CDX - a la carte OAS (expected outperformance vs. benchmark); combine with cash held in repo/T-bills; credit beta WITHOUT ADDING DURATION
  - DV01 is interest rate risk, CR01 is credit risk
  - he also claims IBHY = CDX + 5Y + Crude WTI lmao wait why crude oil??

- "credit value adjustment" CVA - in OTC markets, sometimes need to literally account for counterparty's credit risk, i.e. they forfeit contract from bankruptcy
  - in an exchange environment, not being able to account for this leads to high default risk borrowers taking a good rate offered to everyone; if rate rises
    the quality of borrowers decreases even more lmao
- central clearing party (CCP) helps by being middleman, improving credit risk to the extent of the credit quality of the CCP itself
  - essentially stops chain reaction failures of important financial institutions
  - however, too many CCPs can be a problem because there's not enough netting of counterparty risk!
- research shows that big issuances from risky credit firms create temporary bulges in credit spreads
  across the market as dealers bear extra risk as they search for long-term investors

- funds will give BlackRock $100MM for bonds, but it may end up as cash
  x change to HYG "benchmark index"
  x money market fund is actually sec lending - split them
  . for MMs: "literally what is the spot?"
  - Flow Traders actually do the cash bonds and ETF!
  - Mattheus - if we hold, we have less edge, can't move position around like Flow; fewer traders better for us
  - Alec from Virtu: no mechanism for locking in spread between HYG and futures (he said would be cool to have that on TradeWeb)

- motivation: Salesforce integration allows other customer-facing people to share and contribute to the resource
  - otherwise, we would just upload the spreadsheet to Tableau...
- Johnny created a Salesforce "TagOne", custom object with basic fields, can create as many TagOnes (many to one)
  . Johnny and Hunter will take a look at TagOne
  . I can ping Charlie to test manually maintaining spreadsheet in Tableau

o Danny Jisa - John Coleman - YAS
  - Coleman has always said with this page, it would open the floodgates
  . ask John Coleman what his idea of pricing is - we observe that futures price tracks HYG more than it tracks the underlying futures index,
    so what set of holdings would we do YAS on?
  - on call: futures too convoluted, customers don't want duration exposure, just want credit exposure
    - Michael: we weren't originally targetting that segment - BlackRock and IHS Markit were saying they knew customers who couldn't trade ETFs
      - European UCITS or investments who couldn't touch equities; target is underserved customers
      - ICE already had CDX future, so we weren't planning to replicate that
      - we thought OCC clearing wouldn't be able to compete against ICE clearing (with offsets against CDS, etc.)
  - Coleman: ICE has no cross margin, in fact double gross margin because US listing vs. EU clearing
    - DRW dropped out in 2020-03 because of this, now CDX futures is dead
  - JP Morgan's big fat jelly roll is credit - they're pressured (I didn't understand by who, DRW?)
  - Coleman: "pet" (?) spreads back in the day for credit exposure, back when T-bill futures were a thing
  - Ameribor could have worked as an offset
  - oil is not in CDX, in iBoxx; CCC as well
  - apparently they're saying iBoxx is, like CDX futures, too capital intensive
    - Flow have said major hurdle is not an offset between futures and ETF themselves; we're working through FINRA and SEC to get approval for offsets on OCC
  - poor liquidity past month: our explanation is fewer MMs right now
    - 1 or 2: incentives downgraded
    - 1 or 2: wanted to flow trade it, it's not liquid enough
    - we're hoping to get ETF APs in - firms in there currently aren't uniformly trading HYG, which we think limits ability to keep stable markets
    - Goldman put up a couple European blocks a month, US accounts have reached out to discuss
      - customer reached out to Goldman and JPM in Europe, JPM desk misleadingly said we don't price, they ended up doing TRS
  - Coleman: back in the day Chicago CLOB guys: get your 500 ticks, go home flat, go to Ceres; now you have to roll
    - we must try to get a bunch of BlackRock funds as layoffs
    - gotta find ways to get better cross-margining so MMs want to stay and catch edge; right now John has to convince MMs more than customers
    - lay off risk against each other: vol, rates, credit, rates+credit, ETF crowd coming into rates+credit
  - Coleman pretty bullish on Ameribor...
  - Bloomberg TOMS trade order management system, everybody outsources to Bloomberg
    - our product has to fit into Bloomberg TOMS so it flows automatically
  *- Coleman says YAS is as simple as taking what they output for HYG and do a price/contract scalar by futures and divide by 100,000
CT10->FIHR (fixed income hedge ratio)->par 10MM
  - Launchpad for the hedge ratio
  - Red Pack - Eurodollars trade in packs and bundles. Basically, they're strips of futures and the
    colors represent which parts of the curve. So Reds are the front two years

- HYG cash component analysis:
  - Non-FI Asset Classes:
    - Equity: MYT, SM Energy, Whiting Petroleum, AMC
      - tiny bit from 2020-09 to 2021-07 basically
    - Cash: USD, EUR, "XXX Cash (Committed)"
      - EUR -$72 on 4 days 2018-09-10 to 13; XXX $208,075 on 2020-02-06
    - Money Market: BLK CSH FND Treasury SL Agency
- LQD cash component analysis (2022-03-08):
  - Non-FI Asset Classes:
    - Cash: USD, CAD
      - latter only on 2 days 2019-05-01, 02; $93k
    - Money Market: BLK CSH FND Treasury SL Agency, BLACKROCK CASH CL INST SL AGENCY
      - latter only on 1 day 2019-05-08, $40MM

. realized vol (especially intraday), high-low, close-low, etc.

- 2019-09-02 Labor Day screws with IBHY futures maturity - watch out
  - actually, front month futures price appears as 0 lol
- WOAH result: it appears we MUST extricate HYG p/d from futures-futures index relation
  . plot HYG p/d vs. futures-index p/d
  . run correlation

o Terrance Mayfield
  - c-nii - certification platform (sandbox)
  - nii and cii (production)
  1) can we take off prod?
  2) what do we do to fix the failure?

. what if we changed futures to settle at close of final day of month?
  - right now it's just confusing that we include this rebalance for one day of next month

o Yoshiki and Michael iBoxx
  x add implied borrow after examining...
  x correlation of model price return vs. actual
    - note must account for futures roll - skip that day in the correlation
  . pick 3 days in past year to break down what's happening - take big prem/disc swing day and see if it helps
    . might want to add model returns to case studies...
  . we're fully pricing in collapse to NAV - maybe we need a percentage?
    - this would actually be difficult - need to groupby days to maturity to get different value as function of day...
    - also, remember how implied borrow is also an unknown?
      - best case scenario: using Markit borrow, we come out with an omicron function that is mathematical.
        we then use that to back out implied borrow. logic-wise this is preposterous.

. 2022-01-24 highest single-day VIX futures volume 611,077 highest since 2020-03-06 (618,701) almost 2 years

x send AUM to Ken Hill
  x add TAS volumes - daily for year or for 4th quarter - that's where decreased AUM has biggest impact
  x include YTD 2022 i.e. 2022-01; analysts ask about current state of things even though call is for Q4

o Kaitlin Meyer
  - Michael: ETPs hit retail in the US so makes little sense to pay retail brokers to compete against ETPs that are bringing in payment for order flow;
             VXM in Asia is a different story - the ETPs don't have overnight trading, some Asian ETPs had good traction

- butter up
- Ideally, we would understand enough to come up with a formula that gets us within the bid-ask spread in the IBHY futures market
- "thanks, that's good color on that. I want to talk about that more, but for interest of time I gotta pull you back to the fair value pricing problem. so..."

o Prime MM call 2022-02-03
  - look at HYG, JNK
  - divergence borrowing cost bonds, repo, shares of HYG
  . Litch's Omicron
    x send to Yoshiki reasoning
    . put into formula and do best fit

- traditional spot formula
  - not precise enough though - quote really wide using imprecise formula then adjust
- towards maturity, they're reluctant to stay in
  - spot crude comparison interesting - can't trade spot but have to trade futures, but here there's no intrinsic need to take physical
    (whereas in oil, commodities people DO), but still
*- Fed bought up corporate bonds and ETFs (including SPIB, LQD (6% shares outstanding), JNK, IGIB, VCSH, SPSB, USIG, VCIT, IGSB, SLQD, HYG (1.5% shares outstanding), HYLB)
   with quantitative easing from 2020-05-12 to 2020-12-31; first time in history for ETFs!
  - ETFs purchased through Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), an emergency-lending vehicle created in 2020-03 along with PMCCF (which was not used)
  - 3 phases: 1) stabilization, 2) ongoing monitoring, 3) reduction in support.
  - $75 billion allocated towards ETFs, initially planned to reduce support by 2020-09-30
    - apparently SMCCF peaked at $14.2 billion, didn't use full $750B that came with PMCCF
  - as of 2021-06, Fed aims to sell off ETFs gradually, probably by end of 2021
  . check with Markit borrow, have interesting observations, check with Yoshiki
    - 2019-07 to 2020-03 HYG borrow is weirdly low already, then spikes up for 2020-03 to 05, then tanks again with QE, then back to 2% in 2021-01
      - maybe QE did too much in trying to match the weirdly low era?
  *- this is potentially explanation: easy to borrow HYG, so everyone wants to hedge with HYG; now it's harder to borrow, so correlation down
- we're probably going to give a wide estimate with standard formula, tell people the factors that would affect their view on using it against HYG
. Virtu or Flow?

o Nenye Round 2
  - this time, can you pull up some code and explain to us the components, how they interact, and why it was designed and organized in that way?
  - can you tell us about your research?
  - what other kinds of positions are you simultaneously looking at, if any?

x do the TAC today!

x average volume between 3:15pm to 3:30pm
  - change happened first week of December, 2021 (2021-12-06 I think); it used to be
US=[8:30am, 3:15pm]
Curb=[3:30pm, 4pm]
Asian=[5pm, x)
European=[x, 8:30am)
and now it's, I guess,
???
US=[8:30am, 3:30pm]
Curb=(3:30pm, 4pm]
Asian=[5pm, x)
European=[x, 8:30am)
???
No, according to website, it's
Regular=[8:30am, 3:00pm]
Extended=(3:00pm, 4:00pm] - our new curb?? need to think about this
Extended=[5:00pm, 8:30am)
  - another note for dashboard usage: you prob want to put in 15:16-15:29 since including minute 15 and minute 30 includes volume from before

. Arianne request: customer to customer, firm to firm, customer to firm
  - cross reference between CTI and the "C" or "F" (no MM in futures I think)
  - literally start with just CTI though - CTI 4 vs. other, 4 vs. 4, other vs. other
. add "info" for disclaimer on methodology and also disclaimer that "customer" isn't accurate - includes ProShares, etc.
. troubleshoot spreads volume - may need to just add disclaimer about spreads legging
. way to add aliases in Tableau?

x ping Tiago ASAP on transition email

o Yoshiki Mid-Feb
----
x Yoshiki script: Fed buying HYG - what are the implications exactly? (correlation, etc.)
  - sometimes can't borrow at all - relationship breaks down instead of just more expensive
  - there was no arb formula in the first place, now there's even less of a reason for it to hold
  x futures formula - need bond dividend yield?
    - A: work out the math yourself
  - Michael setting up with Flow and maybe Virtu (Alec is block ETF desk; not electronic market making team;
    latter hates the futures because monthly roll and they got stuck with Union)
. Prime and DV pull out - try median slide 2
. bid-offer spreads throughout the month
. next-month version of slide 4
- light blue loses
- days to expiry
. iBoxx futures intraday orders on open or on day of listing - can our model get inside?
  - ask Charlie about data on this
. run regression get intercept - maybe
. add more slides around correlation oddity
. variance formula - variance of % HYG return = variance of NAV return + variance P/D return + 2Cov(%NAV, %PD)
  - correlation vs. variance? math
. vertically stack correlation by days of month and see if correlation is bad close to maturity between futures and HYG
- implied borrow rate is only meaningful if it's tradeable (synthesizeable!)
----

- MM Pricing Over Life of IBHY Contract - Looking at the Open, Prime
  - 2022-02-01 expiry future, "begins" 2021-10-04, Prime started quoting 2021-11-29
    (a few quotes on 2021-10-25 as response to IB customer trying to sell since 2021-10-11 (!) but not serious)
    - KCLS (Virtu) started quoting 2021-11-02, rest of MMs (DV, Mercury, Tanius) started with Prime
  - in beginning, Prime quoting at start of day around 8:30am AT the market, 15 cents wide
    . what the hell does it mean for marketability_on_activation to be blank space ' ' instead of B, A, W?
      - seems most are orders placed outside of trading hours, often termminated prior to trading begins, often open_close C orders
        . ask about open_close too
      - should filter out of our bid-asks
  *- Prime always opens 16 cents wide (unless there's big event or week before maturity)

x test whether our data better compares to Virtu's independent quoting; A: yes it seems like our P/D Model Pre works with Prime, DV, and Virtu, but just too high
  - Virtu very interesting - quoting alone throughout Nov, 3rd month out, 40-70 cents wide
  - then in Dec when everyone else joins in, they find themselves quoting significantly wider than everyone else and just stop
    - when contract enters front month (Jan), they literally give up
  *- if this carries out for other contract months, this would indicate Virtu are likely pricing fundamentally
  x look at Virtu's Nov prices vs ours!
- DV are actually very wide at the open, exactly like Virtu in their alone month - 35-70 cents!
*- Mercury are 6 cents wide at open every day - they are running the pricing!
- Tanius interesting - quoted for 2 days - 2021-11-29 and 11-30; on 11/29, literally came in 16 cents wide like Prime, with size 1; classic flow quoting

x observe how market makers interact at the open each day in Feb contract (how does Prime have the confidence to do 16 cents?)
  - DV takes the lead pretty wide and very careful, Prime does 16 cents around their mid

x explore alternate MM quote table in DP

x problem in create_percentile_ranks! aggregation should use Jan (1), Apr (4), Jul (7), Oct (10) as quarterly months instead of 3,6,9,12
  to be consistent with month and year showing the left bound!

x write monthly trends for both 2021-12 and 2021-01!
x write TAC script (after you write monthly trends!)

x follow-up meeting with Johnny and Hunter - Tag1s are pretty good! customers already exist in Salesforce, so go to their page and tag account ID
  - account ID is specific, so it would then be linkable to all the other info
  *- an extension field would then allow multiple "contacts" to be included in the Tag1
    - that way (e.g.) handful of top IB customers can be identified and tied to their accounts
      - and it goes the other way too - you'll be prompted to create contact if it didn't exist, so beneficial for contact book too
  x ask to put in an "unsure, please check" flag

o Tiago call 2022-02-10
----
. need to update create_cashflows_dice (use its v2?)
  x specifically, replace its isolated library - BlackRock changing file format is what broke VIXTLT on 2021-09-30,
    latest version of gaibo_modules contains fixes

Tash Scheduler on CHRStudio
VIXTLT:
ETF_TLTdata_toDice - moves file to Edeepfrz
ETF_create_cashflow - runs create_cashflows_dice.py
ETF_Tsy_Scrape_ishares - scrape website

once file on DICE, vic/DICEFiles/, VIXTLT.calc is DICE language executable
  - Tiago put specific logic in to CRASH if we don't get the day's file! (TLTCashFlow_arrayDefinition.csv)
    . have him finish explaining this
DICE then runs this file; contact Rebecca and JungMin if we ever need to 1) create new executable, 2) edit this one because it must be staged

TYVIX:
TYVIX_GetBasket - scrape
_deliveryBasket - create
_FutSymbol - create
_convert_osaka_format - create
_CreateNSend_To_DICE - send to DICE HOURLY
_TYVIX_to_DICE - send end of day value
  . should check how this is different to intraday
----

x ask Tiago to send code for pulling VIXTLT off Data Platform
  - alternate ways to look at it on Data Platform?
  - TYVIX on here? does it still work if we took if off prod and left it only on cert?
- VIXTLT is running again on Index Platform!
- TYVIX needs to be fixed
x for Tiago - all the VIXTLT tenors should be working, right?

. 2019-08-08 and 09 are big outlier days in IBOXIG vs. IBXXIBIG (in addition to 2013-02-01, but we'll scrub that). why???
  - 8/8 IBOXIG -0.35%, IBXXIBIG +0.03%; 8/9 +0.21%, -0.17%

x Michael: figure out on call the options OI
x next is Arianne Tableau
. next is futures trends

x ask Jim Adams about HYG options OI

- Chris Morris
  - emphasize timeliness in addition to "production" FTP

- prove in basis points iBoxx spread isn't much worse than HYG (4bp vs. 2bp)
- how much top of book on average? HYG $1.7MM, us $1.5MM, end of day HYG would hit flow and get $5MM but still
*. we NEED HYG comparison, not just numbers in a vacuum

x Vita dashboard - revive? no, data was bespoke uploaded
  x turn off everyone's subscriptions lol; as of 2022-02-15 there are 6 weekly: Debby Koopman, Andy Lowenthal, Rob Hocking, Michael Mollet, Matt McFarland, Arianne

- here's all the regular analysis I have in code or Tableau (then draw links and alert system!):
  - volume percentiles
  - track_distinct_accounts (in dire need of revival) for iBoxx and VXM unique accounts
  - ETP roll volume
    - ETP AUM, with TAS
  - ETP vega volume equivalence to VIX futures volume
    - ProShares dashboard (last resort for TAS/ETF explanation)

- holy hell, I finally understand the code for ETP "vega per share":
  - vega is dollars affected by 1% change in vol
    - obviously with VIX futures, it's literally constant $1000 vega per contract because the price happens to be linear to change in vol
    - traders hedge dollar vega exposure with VIX futures, etc.
  - ETP share price changes proportionally to VIX (technically the weighted average price between front 2 months of VIX futures).
    therefore, with a 1% change in vol, there is a 1/VIX change in ETP share price - if VIX is 25, that's a 4% change; if ETP price is $20, that's $0.80 vega in that share
    - for the longest time, I thought the formula was ETP price/VIX, but the proper understanding is 1/VIX * ETP price
  - thus, ETP volume * ETP vega per share = dollar vega movement from ETP
    - in a perfect hedge scenario, VIX futures could be moving exactly opposite the ETP vega, 1 contract per $1000 vega (that's how the "VIX-equivalent volume" works)
  - what about Kokusai and Fubon? basically it would be vega per share of 0.80 JPY or TWD instead of USD, so all we need to do is convert to USD either there
    or at the share price (Bloomberg can do that for us)

o Tiago 2022-02-16
----
- VIXTLT has no logic in .calc to crash on stale file - TYVIX does
  - full process:
    1) CHRStudio-automated Python code scrapes iShares website for new data file
    2) CHRStudio-automated Python code generates new DICE input cashflows locally (or fails to generate if no iShares file on website);
       input file is named the exact same filename every single day!
    3) CHRStudio script takes input file and sends to edeepfrzd, overwriting previous day's file
    4) DICE-related script grabs latest input file from edeepfrzd and loads it into DICE??
    5) DICE (live during day) combines VXTLT live index values with input cashflows and live equity prices to generate live BP VIXTLT
  - we observe DICE "broke" and stopped generating BP VIXTLT (step 5) when iShares website files changed format and broke Python code (step 2);
    we are confused - what exactly in steps 3-4 breaks when timestamp on file (filename same every day) is not updated?
  . contact Neelesh about this!
- 2 sources for index data: Index Platform (live), Data Platform (t-1)

. update before Grant Parnon on Wednesday

- had to install 1) impyla and 2) thriftpy2 for Data Platform connection to work according to
  https://wiki.cboe.com/display/DP/Data+Platform+User+Access

- TAC meeting prep
  - hi guys I'm Gaibo from the Cboe, I work for Michael Mollet in Futures, so just gonna quickly go through CFE volume
  - context for VIX for the past two months: September big SPX decrease most of month, huge drawdown after a year of big SPX growth, 240k
    October, also interesting, big SPX recovery after September drop, 200k
    November, also interesting, huge volume days in final 3 days of the month (continuing into December), around Omicron, inflation, hawkish Fed - big volume days around 400k, ADV 225k
  - in context of this, we can look at YTD ADV for VIX of 203k - an average of basically alternating months of 180k and 240k
    we can compare to ADV from this month last year, but any comparison to post-COVID months volumes is just going to look good, because ADV stayed at around 150k finishing out that year
  - looking at quarterly, so far, Q4 on track to be slightly above Q3, which was slightly above Q2, all of which are substantially below Q1's 240k from the Reddit retail volatility 
  - mini-VIX at its core follows big VIX, but overall ADV that we see has sort of stayed constant or even dipped below what it was last year as market makers
    reduce their proportion of volume - you can see YTD ADV is around this month's 11k, last month's 8k was the lowest we've seen, for reference
  - IBHY dropped off in recent months

- I've split off Weekly VIX from Monthly because we may be giving some special attention to Weeklies in the near future
- a lot's been happening in the new year: inflation concerns, hawkish Fed rhetoric, earnings, and even Russia/Ukraine tensions
- literally a 10% drawdown in SPX from beginning of January to the end
  - at the beginning of the month of January, a lot of intraday volatility in SPX and VIX as well, some of it not visible from just looking at EOD
  - VIX hitting 32, highest level since 2021-01
x 2022-01-24 highest single-day VIX futures volume 611,077 highest since 2020-03-06 (618,701) almost 2 years
x 2022-01 ADV highest since 2020-03 (342k)

- the other main focus product is iBoxx corporate bond index futures, specifically the high yield IBHY is the one that's developing first
  - in terms of overall volume, 2022-01 looks really good - overall volume has been dipping since about 2021-09, down to about 500 ADV, we're now rebounded
    back up to 1,100
    - but, the real driver of the volume though, we always gotta emphasize, is the customer volume, CTI 4
  - leading into the holidays we were seeing more unique customers than ever before waiting in the wings, growing month by month for 5 or 6 consec
  - 2021-10 was a huge peak in end customer activity and in the 2 months after it waned a bit
  - in 2022-01, volumes have finally rebounded and customer activity, the real driver of volume in the product, is back to around median levels of past year
  - very active in customer engagement initatives, Michael can elaborate a bit more on iBoxx initatives, for instance Goldman webinar next Friday

x VIX term structure switch - post pics of 2022-01-20 and 2022-01-21
  . this should also be a dashboard! after intraday and realized vol
x look up Russia/Ukraine
  - escalation happened 2022-01-24 - US put 8500 troops on alert
x S&P correction - technically defined as a fall of 10%-20% from a recent peak
  - literally between 1/21 and 1/24, there was a 1% drop from close to open in SPX
. realized vol premium
  - next step in Index OHLC v2! use returns to do running std
. intraday

  - latter updates later - as of 2022-02-17 11:23pm, first has 2/16, latter only 2/15
    - got 2/16 by morning of 2/18 8:24am
  . need to backfill BP VIXTLT (broken from 2021-09 to 2022-02), at least with OHLC for each day using VXTLT's numbers!
  - TYVIX 4.71 after 2020-05-15, revived as VIXZNP 2020-11-27 along with VIXZN (BP)
    - but ultimately everything stops 2021-06-17 (coincidentally at 4.74 again, in meantime, I continue hourly VIXZN, so there we see
      literally isolated effect of CTD I think!)

. ask Charlie: intraday SPX and VIX index values?

. VIX regimes! in evergreen

o Michael new stats ideas
  - correlation/dispersion of component stocks on VIX and VIX futures volume
  - spot up, VIX up, etc. 3700->3685 70->62 (rare, but that means interesting)
  - put skew, call skew
  - VIX decompose to put and call contribution

o Tiago 2022-02-18
  x make sure Tiago 1) sends DP code, 2) responds to questions (with more code)
  - revelation: get_ustf didn't even matter for intraday BP TYVIX - that's my Spyder code! get_ustf was a prototype that never worked
  x ask Rebecca about expirationdates.csv - anything stopping me from spamming lines

- Samudra Dasgupta:
  - Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Harvard MS, then MBA
  - Goldman VP Liquidity Risk Management; BAML Ass VP Corp Investments; hedge fund
  - PhD candidate at ORNL Quantum Computing Inst. and research associate with Purdue

o Rebecca 2022-02-22
  - she used to scrape expirations from CME website - can send code
  . not sure if adding expiries that are not listed yet will break the script
  - I am free to modify as I please - file is dead since all CME things are shut off after contract dispute
  - 3 calculation engines/platforms: ICI (oldest), DICE, and ICP
    *- they are trying to migrate off ICI and shut it down!
       . we need to email Brian Eck about saving old TYVIX in addition to VIXTLT
  - since the "VIX problem", we must copy Dennis and co. on everything related to VIX
    - anything related to old VXO is in big trouble according to Rebecca

o SG Americas iBoxx 2022-02-22
  - guy wants margin methodology
  - SG can do 2 things: 1) being MM, 2) take blocks (Scott and Romain)
    - Qs: 1) How many clients for blocks? especially IG? how much size?
      - A: Mainly asset management, not hedge funds. Insurance client. $150MM trades, some clients won't get out of bed without $1B
    - 2) How many MMs can do $200-300MM blocks?
      - A: 3. Some banks. Should emphasize that it's 1 bank doing almost all of it, 1 of those (bank) has never won.
    - 3) How will clients know we're in and quoting blocks?
      - A: 2 angles: one is your SG marketing team bringing over existing customers, the other is us
    - 4) Why is volume so small?
      - A: Block liquidity was relatively recent. To be candid, screen liquidity has also been an issue - active MMs are not involved in ETF MM.
           The rest of it is marketing. We have literally never had a convo where someone's told us this product doesn't make sense - it is
           chicken and the egg. So we're bullish but need to get MMs involved in MM the ETF to come and brace the screen liquidity.
           The market is far from saturated.
    - can partner on webinar and see how much client interest there is?
    . I think Michael misrepresented the incentive program - made it sound like there is no volume-weighted payment

- Charlie: for complex orders in order_summary, need to use complex_contracts_traded for volume (technically, size). this is because
  traded_qty is # of "packages", and each package could be a 10-leg trade instead of normal 2-leg
  - so basically: sum(case when simple_complex='S' then traded_quantity else complex_contracts_traded end)
- Charlie: order_fill now has contra info!
- Charlie: adding on_behalf_of (owner of clearing arrangement) to order_summary (in addition to firm which is port owner)
  - this was literally just an overlooked detail that I caught and got confused on

. change how we do customer "volume" - it should literally always be size EXCEPT during percentages of total
  . the change would have to be in Historical Daily Lookup! there will no longer be 0.5
    . then make the change in percentiles code - must divide by 2 just prior to division by total for the percent!
  - ah that's def why I have the 0.5, because it is used in the %
  - doesn't matter, we have to change it
  - spreads: doesn't matter - 1 spread equals 2 contracts

- Tableau: 1) date highlighter could be very nice, 2) Analysis->Legend allows you to hide cards on and off!

x 2022-02-28: new iBoxx customer sold 248 ($35m) on block to GS on the back of Friday’s (2022-02-25) webinar!

---- 2022-03-01 Return from Orlando ----

- 2022-03-01: Alec, Frantz gone
- 2022-01-24 to mandatory launch 2022-02-27: CFE country codes must be marked with trades
  - not a reg thing, so SocGen etc. are taking another couple weeks to straighten things out with Fidessa; data may not be perfect for a while

x Bob Siverson
x Yoshiki

o Michael list
  *x Arianne Feb summary by Friday
  x call with SEC on iBoxx RBH - Jim will send once we send index methodology (for both) and data
    x 4 corner flowchart: ask Jim, send prospectuses for HYG/LQD? benchmark index methodologies? try not to
      x data
      x how much do we filter out? send some info
      x Litch Venn diagram slide?
    x forward Art's stuff to Jim so he can model SEC filing after CFTC; edit Jim's stuff after if needed after the cut-and-paste
  . update iBoxx studies - and add pricing when first listed - re-contact SocGen next week, new contact at Virtu, Danny says Arb interested too
    *- Goldman: Oliver ahead of webinar said underpriced, they would hit bid all day
    - Flow: can get better borrow rate than others on HYG, so like to be in and out in bursts; need RBH to make it less capital intensive to hold
    - Citadel, Old Mission - discuss market making in iBoxx (low delta discussions)
    . Jenn in NY met with Millenium, big hedge fund with different teams that provide funding - share most updated deck, don't need pricing bit
    . what about looking at blocks? can we do case studies on how block looks against rest of market
  x CP3 - Dennis does quarterly review of iBoxx, test for high yield (not IG) is bumping against "% constituents that have an ISIN" or something RIC at 80%
    - Dennis manually searches in Bloomberg, maybe it's only 80% because not in Bloomberg, maybe it's actually 90 etc.
    x ask Dennis about this
      x ask Franz and Nic about files to automate this without Bloomberg (if they can't, we should make automated Bloomberg spreadsheet)
    o Meeting
      - 3(a)(12) security exempt piece - what this means is you can have futures on it, e.g. Treasury securities are sec but you can have futures on it (CFTC)
      - Pallavi has automated monthly process
        - basically it seems like Bloomberg is not picking up the filing data, so it's blank
      x basically set up call with Frans to ask for this field for regulatory purposes (Dennis says this is the only one they need)
  . OEO IDs tied to subaccount numbers in VIX (OEO IDs used to be more informative, get the old ones)
    . may need to ask Charlie? explore order_summary beyond 2018

. add iBoxx-specific customer-to-customer breakdown once new field is in!
. add # std move to OHLC!

- UST 10yr yields had huge drop, huge increase in IEF price
  . Treasury vol! mention in futures trends
- Fed uncertainty is back after rate hike pace for 2022 and March in particular have plummeted

o Stacey Gilbert, SIG behavioral econ person
  - volatility risk premium (VRP) aka implied risk premium - implied (priced in) consistently above realized
    - average 4.2% 1990-2022
  - options are tough for retail because they're designed to equalize over a lot of notional and years
    - percent of the event (e.g. 10% up/down in 3 months) actually happening is like 5% - do you have enough capital for it to be worth losing 19x?

x god damn it Treasury rates reader XML URL https://data.treasury.gov/feed.svc/DailyTreasuryYieldCurveRateData broken after 2022-02-18!
  x website has changed, need to figure out how to get full history now
    - oh god, XML sheet now has non-constant number of fields. this means m_properties isn't a tidy 12 numbers long - it starts out as
      only 9! so need to literally check each entry for d_bc_1year, d_bc_3month, d_bc_2month, etc.!
    - only 1 data change: 2017-04-14 used to be a terrible data artifact of 0s, now the row has been removed! good job treasury.gov!
- 2022-03-03: CMT yields are different now, and the documentation is better!
  - on 2021-12-06, Treasury switched to monotone convex spline (MC) method for deriving official par yield curves; used to be quasi-cubic Hermite spline (HS)
    - all old rates are still canon of course
  - 20-year bond reintroduced on 2020-05-20 btw

x formatting for monthly report is whacko. who do I ask?
  - Gina says gremlins happen
  - missing picture - use + button under create!
  - + button SharePoint File to basically upload a Word doc

- average VIX move or something to help table
  - logic is people will say "there's a war, why isn't there more volume??"
  - A: 25-35 area in VIX is no-man's land - people don't want to bet on it going up, people are still scared of shorting as well
    - if I'm long, I'll let it ride, if I'm short, I'll already have gotten out
  . add daily VIX index to futures volumes too
- VIX term structure stuff can go into new setup of Sharepoint regular writings
- take out awkward sentence at end
- TAS share - low because of AUMs
  - interplay here is that VXX at $900MM seems high AUM but VIX is at 30+ so few contracts to roll!
  - not as actively traded as before - VXX US Equity NAV on BBG -> fund flow big red drops
  - people historically created VXX shares to short it; if VIX goes up, redemptions happen
  . potentially just chart big ETPs estimated VIX futures holdings
  - vega per share, getting smaller with reverse splits
  - need to answer question "volume is less now than in 2017, but here's why (in context of ETPs, etc.)"
    *- this ties into how they set revenue budget expectations from the board!

. add our dashboards to https://wiki.cboe.com/display/GCS/Updates->Futures
  - volume update, 3 new initiatives, etc.

. add light blue to filling space between index holdings chart?

o Steeven Bensusan and Jeremie Ouaki (SocGen) 2022-03-11
  - iBoxx maturities aren't IMM dates (TRS maturities) because Markit operationally didn't want to overburden
  x must check Markit - MMs probably don't pay anything right?
    - futures index data free now because they have a license for HY and IG, Markit retains the right to charge for it though

- Alec Olesky (dad founded TradeWeb) left Virtu, we spoke with the replacement guy earlier this week, they agreed it may be time to look closer

. check factor fitting
. write function that reads iBoxx from local cache and updates from Bloomberg iff out of date!
. modify rolling corr function to use days
. check whether we can match Oliver's comments of overpricing underpricing
  - 2021 summer: overpriced
  - 2021-11: it has stopped being overpriced
  - 2022-02 late: underpriced
. think about what's doable with Arianne derivative markets page

*- even after patching dividends, we're seeing for DV in 2021-12 contract:
  we're matching very closely their opening prices before rolling into 1st month, but during 1st month, they switch to underpricing!
  . does this carry out for other months??

o Michael
  . BZX VIX ETP LMM scorecard - how active they are - Virtu not very active right now...
    - e.g. if ADV in VXX in Feb is 70MM shares, only 10% traded on BZX, so we don't have full visibility
    . does what we see mirror what we would see elsewhere? what's the potential reasoning for firms being more aggressive on other exchanges?
    . short interest reports every 2 weeks on all BZX ETPs (cboe.com/us/equities/market_statistics/short_interest/)
    o Victor Werny
      - "reference price" is the imbalance minimizing price; we know it as the clearing price
      - LMM SAI % - size at inside
        - Virtu had 0% in all of the ETPs (except 4% in VIXM ProShares mid-term)
        - hard for MMs to be "inside" constantly in highly-traded products
      - EDGX - retail-geared, 7% VXX (vs. 10% BZX), maker-taker
      - Jump has 4 MPIDs, likely 4 separate desks, 4 clearing separately
  - Barclays VXX and oil ETF 2022-03-14 no more creations
    - L10265 is one of their known accounts
----
- VIX ETP monitoring: 1) AUM, roll volume, TAS, 2) vega volume futures contract equivalence
- realized vol (on SPX, on VIX, on everything actually) vs. implied; intraday as well
- OHLC percentiles (std dev moves): 1) index, 2) futures price
- customer-to-customer vs. customer-to-MM
- growing products - distinct accounts
- volume percentiles

. Daily Lookup - further breakdown of TAS and Spreads - how much is customer, etc.?

o Yoshiki 2022-03-14
  x plot DV, Virtu, Prime, try no lines just markers; F_morning line
  x do one just DV mid bid-offer and model price (dot); up and down and model dot in middle
  x grid lines
  x constant axis frequencies
  x explain Oliver in email

- note: matplotlib plotting empty DF will throw x-axis range way off for some reason
- note: Prime was Clear Capital before 2021-10!

x other MM's bid-asks
x spot check interactions
  - wooow back in 2021-07-15, DV had a different EFID! DVZC Zeke was still coming in at 8:30am and leading, but EFID DVTR wasn't until 9:15am!!
    - note also that DVTR went through firm CQCI for a while: 2021-06-01 to 2021-10-18
      - DVTR DVTR: 2021-07-27 to present
             DVZC: 2021-06-01 to 2021-07-27
  *- so Zeke himself is the difference! he stopped quoting after 2021-07-27, and they started opening way wider
     - could the CQCI DVTR be the DV2 guy who blew up? yup it's the one man show who couldn't cover costs after roll prices went sour into maturity 2 months in a row
       - he doesn't quote as actively as Zeke and Walter for sure - opening quotes are usually 9am or 10am
         - since he waits, he opens way tighter on his first quotes - which is why quoting on EFID DVTR looked so much tighter pre-2021-07! it wasn't Zeke and Walter using that EFID
     - could the DVTR DVTR be Walter taking over for Zeke? looks like it
x isolate Zeke from Walter from DV2
  - code by default shows only Walter for DVTR, need EFID DVZC for Zeke
. further back in time MM mids

o Yoshiki
  . try close to open HYG return to previous futures price - how well it matches actual futures open
  . use iNav - think about it more
----
Current model is: stale S, HYG open price/prev NAV change
Notes: open price prev NAV change is like combination of 1) open price prev price change and 2) prev price prev NAV prem;
INAV 1: pseudo-not-stale S (stale S * HYG open price/prev price change), open price/open NAV prem
               Notes: should we use HYG open NAV/prev NAV change instead of price?
INAV 2: futures price as of yesterday's close * HYG close-to-open return
----
    - with stale futures index, what makes sense? do we need to augment that to a pseudo-non-stale value?
    - 1) HYG price premium at open to iNAV, apply to augmented stale index
      2) apply close to open HYG change to stale index
  . ask Michael about presenting to DV, ask them what we're missing
    - can say all the MMs opening mids are similar, don't have to claim they're leading others
  . ask Michael about close prices before MMs start quoting
    . what if...

o Alex Lynch 2022-03-16
  x can I either ping Chris on Bloomberg or email him for a follow-up call?
    - prefer one point of contact
    x pinged: green dot Chris did not respond on BBG

. add single element compatibility to universal_tools.share_dateindex
. over course of day?

. may need to add between_time() to mids
. what if 0 borrow rate? what if we put borrow rate + or - on chart and see if that explains Oliver?
. can we quantify NAV difference vs. price difference (and the implied premium effect?)
- Prime and DV are trading throughout the day, so must be something different

. profile spot check wash trades in rolls

*- the ultimate realization: Cboe puts out official closing price from day 1, more than a month before MMs starting quoting
  - they do this by copying the 2nd month's price into 3rd and 4th month
  - hypothesis: no MM is ever actually pricing from scratch - they just apply HYG change to the base Cboe price
    - as Walter said - there's always a previous price...
- other hypothesis: Oliver at Goldman is pricing using futures index, while the MMs are doing this. that's why he sees the long-term over- and under-pricing

. look at open and close returns - price close from open
  - open to open, close to close, all using HYG
  - chart for open, yesterday's open, closing prices based on today's open, clsoing based on yesterday's close
    - the optimal chart would be:
      1) MMs opening quote mids (traditional colors)
      2) prev futures price with HYG close-to-open price change applied (dotted black)
      3) slight modification of 2): start applying from 1st day of official Cboe price
      4) slight modification of 2): start applying from day of first MM quote (can approximate with 3rd month if needed)
      5) futures index prev close (in light red)
      6) futures price prev close
      6) base model (no prem/disc)
      7) p/d model
      8) maturity settle value highlighted?
      9) average abs off from first quoted mid in legend?
      - 2021-11 onwards is great because it shows how close we are to Virtu in the alone month
  . essentially: 1) price open from close, 2) price close from open, 3) price close from close, 4) price open from open
    - we've done 1) and 3); chart 3) and do 2) and 4) with same charting!
    - logically, we can simplify: do 1) and 2) and by definition we're set for all 4!

. the other thing to prove is sleep theory - how does it wake up??? first MM? at what point... 2nd 3rd 4th month track HYG?? verify
  - understand first tick action (going from stale to not)
  - tricky here because even when "stale", it's tracking 2nd month which tracks HYG really well
    . for each contract, chart correlation with HYG for entire 4 month span
      . correlation for 1) open to open return and 2) close to close return!

. do Arianne dashboard planning

. Litch/Kathy sheet

o ProShares
  - ProShares actually had a swap with VXX in case 75% margin
  - ProShares don't have a share count issue anymore - filed with SEC to have unlimited number of shares
    - some people have share count issue, and in fact redemptions don't count towards negative
  - our theory: shelf registration ($20B), we've been told their bumping up against limit of shelf registration
    - VXX itself allows $8B? need to file for more
  - both 33 Act funds
  - ProShares had a 1-beta, competes directly with USOs, but USOs use options; Bloomberg Barbell index?
    - USO has no index; they were levered 2x, no one wanted to own front month 2x
  - ProShares has Oil K on Cboe, asking about who to talk to about that on listing team - Omar Woodhouse
  - they think it was an oversight that snuck up on Barclays
  - VIXY options are listed but they just don't really trade like they do on VXX
  - remember original VXX expiring and they did a new one? apparently ProShares tried to steal their symbol hahaha tried to steal customers
    . ProShares can't offer borrow (?), their borrow is all over the place - people have to create to lend with a box combo basically
      - tried to ask bank friends for a favor: "create to lend", but then bank would have to short the index, lend out the ETF, tough to do
      - people are like "look if you can guarantee me borrow..." but that's ProShares's big problem they can't
  . question: was it retail demand that drove it to a premium?
    - Michael: so much of VXX was held short...
  - question: complex products legal thing
    - Michael: they just got briefed on FINRA's concerns - levered products, options, etc.; don't know path forward yet
    - they will be very aggressive on helping with this
  - they move in share value from VIX to nat gas? they pay in arrears now, which may be important to the story
  . London firm suing for using settlement price in NAV calculation? (Bitcoin)
    - ProShares eager to fight this
  . ICE's whole thing was being able to steal CME's prices??
  - USO

o Stuart Barton VolatilityShares
  - skeptical of shelf registration - if you're causing a run while short capital, that isn't good
  - APs are all big names - Goldman, Credit Suisse, etc.; LMMs - Flow, etc.
    - everyone was in on a new volatility product

x add from start HYG history to charts to see which one is "fairly priced" and which isn't
. configure HYG total return to open and compare to magnitude of difference at close - is it intraday pressures distorting futures price? morning is pure
. change borrows to 0 to get better context in latest months

. how can it diverge from HYG? there is some code problem

. outline of PowerPoint by Thursday
  - main idea: empirical snapshot of the present - MMs are in fact pricing by using HYG returns and applying them to the last observed price
    - to replicate this market price, it does not appear you ever need to price from scratch - in beginning of contract, Cboe provides an official
      closing price even when there are no quotes
      - they do this by copying over the 2nd term futures price (which is quoted)
  - what this means is that the contract empirically behaves EXACTLY like HYG (this could stop at any time) (currently, the index does not matter)
    - it's what the MMs want, but it appears to be what all customers want as well
      - we theorize that MMs go wide in the final week because they have no idea how to reconcile the baseless futures price with the settlement index
        - however, in theory, if everyone closes out before the final few days, no one is screwed by the close
      - the only customers who would want otherwise would be someone wanting to track the index instead of HYG, and we don't know anyone like that
        - if someone like that wants to enter the product with a formula capable of tracking the index to settlement, they are free to do so
          and change the meta and make money off the MMs by carrying position into maturity. we just haven't observed it and doubt it's possible - 
          it seems impossible for anyone to want/be capable of precisely tracking/holding that basket of 1000+ bonds
  - we observe that the market is a kind of a dirty secret - everyone wants the product to be HYG, treats the product like HYG, even though it's not
    - if it quacks like a duck...
    . how do we say this in a way that is not problematic with regulatory?
      - maybe: flip the presentation the opposite way - if it was possible to price the futures "the right way", people would have done so
        - because the normal way is unrealistic in this world due to limitation of bonds, we observe this is what people have gravitated towards
          - it just so happens that everyone is happier this way - no one is forcing anyone else to collude - if there was a way to arbitrage
            this meta, someone would
          - our argument should then be that it's NOT some dirty little secret

- Barclays TAS is LXBL10265 for month of March, used a different one before L10265 or something
  - ETN doesn't have to trade VIX futures! they just need S&P vega constant maturity, could be SPX options, variance swaps, even VIX options
  - ETF is different, has to trade futures, and there's more from being levered or inverse

. super critical to have something explaining how to link together charts in exec dashboard
  - good example is VXX halting creations - how is it causing 40k-50k contract loss?

- SpireX guy started LimeWire, so Lime Brokerage and Latour are both from SpireX
  . would want to know how much of their trading of VXX etc. flows back into VIX futures

. put up Daily Lookup ASAP, experiment with uploading to Tableau ASAP
  . put ETPs summary in by Friday, will need to refine because everyone's going to ask about VXX effect this week
    . make it so we can point to a chart on 2022-03 futures trends
      - may be a while even after VXX recovers before our volume is back
      - MM volume more heavily impacted, customers less so
        - Cube, Parallax, etc. hold so much VXX - they will be super affected

- Susq and Citadel are BofA's 2 biggest customers

o Kevin Nichols, Jeff Moore, Future of Futures
  - firm clearing range at OCC is still our best gauge of firm vs. customer (capacity? C vs. F, no MM unlike equity)
  - MPID of BofA, CTI 4 tells customer, CTI 2 tells permit holder (we would consider to be MM), but on its face we can't tell
    - CTI code is used by billing, so batch is familiar with it for sure
  - I can show Kevin Nichols and team our Tableau dashboards to see how we massage DP data
. ask Charlie - is trade "aggressor" just the one who's listed first? is that same thing as "taker"?

. update and send to Kathy

- constant mix (i.e. rebalancing) strategy is 1 of 4; also buy and hold, constant proportion, option-based portfolio insurance
  - constant mix is contrasted to CPPI (constant proportion portfolio insurance) which has convex payoff characteristic
    - CPPI involves shrinking allocation in risky asset as falls (down to 0 to preserve baseline - deleveraged!), increasing convex as it rises
Vol Demand Trends
- after 2008, hedge funds not leveraging and using equities as much, but almost recovered as of 2014
- volatility adjustment industry switching to target vol funds in 2014 (like CPPI but for vol?)
- correlations (SPX vs. CRY commodities and DXY USD) increased after 2007, started dropping towards 2014 (what happened after??)
  - along with decrease in perceived tail-risks, real money was less interested in tail risk funds
- VIX ETPs AUM reaching steady state
  - some retail but dominated by RIAs (managing money for private wealth investors)
- after 2008, seeing increase in VIX call buying and elevated VIX call skew
  - driven by non-equity (credit investors)
  - using CDS to hedge credit portfolios carries big basis risk - didn't work in 2008
    - CDS options have historically been very rich so not good systematic hedges
  - equity vol has higher corr with credit spreads compared to equity returns (??)
  - cost of VIX options known upfront; VIX futures cost is roll, only known ex-post!
    - rationale: I am earning 6% yield on portfolio, I am willing to spend 1% on hedging
- VIX derivs dominating index options
  - more vega being traded in VIX related instruments - used to be just SPX & SPY options,
    VIX futures and VIX ETPs vega growing in lockstep since 2010 and overtaking in 2013
  - open interest as of 2013 is still SPX/SPY by 6x over VIX futures and a bit more over ETPs
Vol Supply Trends
- 2010 was when XIV/short vol strats hit mainstream
- 2013 IV much lower relative to SPX returns - options premium collected from buy-write very low, bad strat for that year
- VIX futures liquidity actually driven by ETPs 2009-2012; liquidity shifting from commercial to non-commercial traders (??)
- VIX dynamic and leveraged ETPs can exacerbate moves in VIX futures!
Landscape
- VRP driven by net demand for options from hedgers
- return distribution implied by option prices has fatter tails than empirical (because demand for downside protection puts)
- demand for portfolio hedging, so index options more expensive than single stock
  - selling pressure for single stock options from call overwriting
- vol term structure upward sloping because short term realized vol low, long term there is tons of hedging
- significant ETP outflows when VIX spikes (how much??)

Krag (Buzz) 2014 - Absolute Goldmine, better than Krag 2016 which I previously read
- VIX characteristics: negcorr to global equity indeices, manager performance; poscorr to credit
  - user groups: equity investors to implement directional views on vol, credit investors (futures and options) as diversifying broad market hedge
*- high correlation between SPX term structure and VIX term structure??
- VIX is high it's time to buy, VIX is low it's time to go lol
- what drives VIX trades?
  Risk premia to trade:
  1) vol risk premium (VIX - 1M realized vol); Krag says when spread is high, low RV tends to "pull" VIX lower
  2) term premium (VIX future - VIX spot)
  4 drivers of VIX futures profitability:
  1) S&P 500 returns (VIX negatively correlated)
    - market down, options up, VIX up; VIX more reactive to market down than up (can we quantify? actually a chart with SPX up and VIX down works)
  2) term structure premium (have futures already priced in your view on top of spot?)
  3) VRP (is VIX trading high relative to market vol?)
    - this relative link is crucial, otherwise VIX as an absolute level loses sight
  4) mean reversion factor (is VIX high or low relative to long-run average?)
    - VIX spiking can cause inversion of term structure, but very temporary backwardation compared to long-term contango
      - in dull markets and curve is steep, good for short, bad for long; hedgers should roll middle of curve to minimize carry cost
- cool regression model with 0.81 R^2
. we're not tracking roll cost properly in iBoxx - do it like Krag - 1st and 2nd month contract drawdown over month for as many months as we can
  . should also replicate his study on which of the last 5 days is best to roll out
- S&P puts vs VIX calls: strike risk big with upward trending SPX, VIX calls usually better when SPX moves down quickly, but if it bleeds, there
  is "drag down" on VIX and VIX goes nowhere up!
. page 23 minimum var hedge - can we apply to futures volume model? i.e. if all SPX was hedged...
. maintain futures volume pie chart of 1st month, 2nd month, 3rd month, > 3 months

- brainstorm for tracking iBoxx position - if we added contract name and buy/sell to volume breakdown, we could make pivot table...
  - dashboard showing day's change to prev would be great

- Goldenberg is a trading firm that literally makes money off of incentive programs - super tight spreads, super small size

- iBoxx index is like New York time 6pm-6:30pm, from prices struck around 4pm - ETF NAV global consensus
  - used to be people liked 3pm
- we need more timely index to do TAS on iBoxx futures to index (confusingly, Michael and Litch are calling this "NAV")

#### 2022-03-28 Goals: 1) publish Percentiles dashboard, 2) publish realized vol dashboard, 3) add ETP vega data to Tableau

Dashboards to get out the door:
1) Percentiles
  - ported for now. see below for notes on next versions
  . customer volume for example: want MM contribution to be clear as reasoning
2) Realized vol
  - S&P RV index construction: SPX index (no TR I think), log returns, 0 mean, N in the denominator, 252 to annualize, 21, 63, 126, 252 for months!
  - oh god damn it, I've been doing realized vol wrong because I use stock std dev functions - those do difference from mean, but we want mean=0!
  . how do I do vol risk premium in Tableau?? can't realign things??
    - design the optimal export from Python? ask Charlie how best to join table to itself within Tableau
  . how to reverse table calc so I can graph left to right loool??
    - idea of using parameters - need to check if it works with just numbers first: change 20, 0 to 0, -20 basically
3) ETP vega volumes
  - consider vega per share, etc. is available in ETP roll volumes but not used - combine the export for both?
4) ETP roll volumes
5) Futures OHLC (in addition to index OHLC)
  - can copy from Daily Lookup as a starting point, but will need to port over calculations from Index OHLC
6) Commitment of Traders - explains some ETP color, explains OI underlying causes

. I do have ideas for using Tableau table calcs to do percentiles natively in Tableau
  - it just would take a bit of time, but we could swap out the pre-made 252, 12, 4, etc. for parameters that then trigger flags for linked
    filtering on "daily", "monthly, "quarterly", etc.
    - we would be able to show all of history then, instead of filtering by relative date
. at first data source overwrite at beginning of 2022-04, we'll see how to deal with column types, naming, etc.

x use EQY_SH_OUT_REAL instead of EQY_SH_OUT and see if there's historical
  - confirmed it is NOT historical! only con.ref

- Barclays filed with SEC to issue debt securities $20.8B: VXX, VXZ, OIL, etc. for high net-worth individuals, etc.
  - shelf registration (can see on SEC website)
  - can create an allocation and sell it to an individual
  - turns out they LOST TRACK OF HOW MANY THEY HAD CREATED
    - they "lost the spreadsheet"
  - accidentally issued over $36B!!!
  - now it's called "recision" - we sold you these valued at X, so we'll buy them back from you at that price
    - but look at VXX where it was 100 and now it's 20

. I should actually take PHDG, VQT, and ZIVZF out - we're not estimating vega per share accurately, and PHDG actually has substantial size of 100s of VIX-equiv

I just got a call from Michael Mollet. What happened?

So I just want to speak plainly for a second - for the record. Michael had a vision from day one, he trusted me to build out the vision, but I'm the one who screwed up.
In the past year and a half, I struggled with psychological issues and burnout and I held back so much of our potential. [UP] I finally felt like I was stepping back into my old
self three or four months ago, and was excited with the pace of progress we were finally starting to turn up. However, it was never going to work with just 2 people -
our absolute top priority should have been to hire more people.
So, this is all wrong. If anything, I should be gone, not Michael. I don't know if this is how it works, but if you can fire me and bring back Michael, that would be
in the best interest. For sure.

So, what's next?
iBoxx fair value - studying market prices for iBoxx futures - our result was proof that market makers are not pricing off fair value, and that it's unclear whether it exists
our next step was writing up and investigating
VIX analytics - a smattering of 15ish small dashboards, refining as we go, stitching together workflows into a master, exec-friendly dashboard
VIXTLT basis point index

So who do I report to? Should I try to get absorbed by Michael Shea and his team? they've been very nice and have reached out

Litch and Jenn and team - what happens to them? I ask because Michael worked on a daily basis with them to coordinate business development for iBoxx,
and we literally had a call with our BlackRock contact just now that I cancelled

- intro: so I can talk about VXX effect on futures. I'm not sure how much of this stuff you talk about regularly, so I'll quickly go from beginning.
- 2 drivers of VIX futures volume: 1) customer activity (CTI 4 trades), 2) ETPs
  - the rest is risk recycle from the movement generated by these 2 sources
- now being more specific on #2 ETPs, there are 2 effects from ETPs: 1) AUM-based roll volume from issuers rolling position,
  2) something we call VIX-futures equivalent vega volume - that is, as these equity shares move back and forth, what if VIX futures are going the other way, as if
  hedging away all the vega
  - the first is based purely on AUMs, and it's a relatively small effect - ETPs are rolling just 2k-3k contract daily to maintain constant exposure to VIX
    - actually a little bit less than we're even estimating, because for example ETNs don't need to fully fulfill the daily rebalance, and ETFs like ProShares VIXY has Goldman TRS for half
  - the second is based on current futures price and ETP volume - we have a vega per share that we multiply with ETP volume
    - and THIS IS WHERE WE GET HIT BY VXX VOLUMES taking a sharp drop after the 2022-03-14 creation halt
- we have code for looking at both estimated roll volumes and estimated ETP vega volumes
  - I can tell you the change in roll volumes of VXX stemming from the $300MM drop in AUM is only 1k contracts a day
  - now let's dive into the vega volumes piece:
    1) table for volumes average change, including UVXY and SVXY
      - UVXY big volume hit, but unlike VXX, AUM did not drop. our explanation for mechanism here is:
      - our automatic reasoning for UVXY taking a corresponding volume hit is that people do long-short with VXX and UVXY to replicate inverse vol, because SVXY is 0.5x
        - and to back that up we can see SVXY has in fact seen a slight uptick in vega activity, presumably from
          - but we've heard strong aversion to the 0.5x multiplier, so people aren't flocking
        - based on this theory of VXX+UVXY, VolatilityShares's newly released as of today SVIX 1x inverse ETP would alleviate the negative effect of VXX on UVXY,
          so we should keep an eye on that
    2) chart for vega vs. futures
      - the effect that I am claiming in this chart is the X contracts
        - now going back to the table, I would attribute that X to VXX volumes declining, X to UVXY volumes declining
      - but keep in mind the scale is not usually 1-to-1 - it's supposed to be less - not every ETP share is getting offset by VIX futures - so we're not explaining away all X

- futures
  - equity (stagnant)
    - VIX futures + options
      - appetite for VIX now after 2 historic blowups in 2 years is different than in 2016-2017
        - before that, when was the last blowup - like 2008? with ETPs coming into play in a big way 2010-2014, and very calm development after,
          the ecosystem in 2017 was very special
      - things were never the same after Feb-5, and before people could even get Feb-5 out of their backtests, 2020-03 happened. now,
        as 2020-03 is passing out of the 2-year backtest, we have new crises happening that are distorting the numbers in their own way
    - from what we've heard from speaking to banks, it's the same guys in VIX as before, but plenty have dropped out from the blowups and switched away
      - we doubt there's any more significant customer potential at this point
    - Michael fiercely against tweaking things to squeeze out a few hundred more contracts - focus should 100% be outside VIX
  - credit
    - iBoxx futures + options
      - iBoxx VIX on top of options
    - existing Credit VIX based on Markit options data
  - fixed income
    - VIXTLT index replacing CME Treasury options VIX
      - all the knowledge from the CME TYVIX pointed to 1) need basis point version, 2) time wasn't right
      - well now our data isn't as cool, but we have the basis point in our sights, and 2022 is prime time for rates vol
    - products on the index - need to learn from TYVIX failures
- Arianne: VIX needs 1) 7th-9th inning customer outreach, 2) content, 3) retail, 4) tweaking (TAS, fees, pennies)

- to Kevin Nichols: I have no idea what data looks like on equities
  - I've heard here and there, "this field is different for equities/options", etc. like "capacity" for futures is "firm" or "customer", but for equities there's "MM" + others
    - I've heard maybe the "maker/taker" field is different for options
  - I can tell you about Data Platform fields that I use and how I use them, but I myself have a lot of questions - the root source of low-level info is Eileen's data analytics

- to Kathy Nguyen: hey do you have a minute? so, Michael Mollet was fired yesterday. pretty sudden. I'm sort of scrambling to figure out what's next and prob will be doing so.
  I can try to answer questions you had for him especially on iBoxx, and Litch will be the resource there as well when he comes back on Monday.

x get numbers for ETP presentation
x call Dennis and Michael Shea

- for now though, I need to be there as the person people ask about futures, because without that, our current vision is gone.
  I think I need to see the fight out until the end, when I'm no longer the person to ask.

x send VXX effect write-up to group
x send data to Nick Godec, propose more resources
x talk to Jenn

. update VIXTLT Jira and send to Dennis

x figure out SSH keys
  - couldn't get it to work on Stash though, still using HTTPS
. commit iBoxx folder to Stash
  . commit currently edited code
. put temporary scratch code into GZAP Git ASAP
. bundle everything in OneDrive and commit

- "market structure" is the name for tweaking to pennies, etc.

. Arianne mini dashboards
  - Percentiles
  - Distinct Accounts
  - Charlie's CFE Activity Dashboard - in stasis, my current revamp will involve tweaking this and brining it out of Sandbox
    - turn on CTI 4, etc.
  - Mini-VIX dashboard (we didn't really use)

. FCST notes
  - for VIX, too difficult with Fed rates and war and then VXX, default to last year's 230k
  - for iBoxx, Michael used a 12.5% growth per month's ADV on the budget; what do I do?
    - tough because we're expecting it to improve once we secure SocGen's improved pricing
---- Final
x VIX: too difficult to assess with Fed raising rates and war and then VXX
  - ADV: stay the course but drop 50k for VXX
  - RPC: also stay the course because CTI 4 (customer volume share) appears to have stabilized after being elevated for 4 quarters after 2020-03
x VIX Weekly: analogous logic to big VIX, except there is no "stay the course"
  - ADV: first 2 months of year are down from past 4 years, so we can attribute this to 2022 regime - scale last year's total ADV down by Jan+Feb decrease for 11
  - RPC: CTI 4 analysis is inconclusive on such small ADV - assume same RPC as total last year
x Mini VIX: analogous logic to big VIX, but can't "stay the course" because it's a growing product
  - ADV: drop for VXX and MM impact from VXX in big VIX
  - RPC: "stay the course" from above-expectations positive RPC of 2022-02
x IBHY: purely from CTI 4 volume, back in 2021-03, 30 accounts were doing 130 avg size per active account;
        predicting 50 accounts each doing 100 for 5000 customer contracts, multiplier from customer volume 7% in 2022 with new MM incentive: 3500 ADV
  - ADV: 20% growth each month sets us up for 3500 ADV in Q4
  - RPC: using those ADV numbers, from scratch formula with $125,000 monthly incentive
x IBIG: cannot do same analysis from IBHY
  - ADV: 12.5% growth as before
  - RPC: using ADV, formula with $50,000 monthly incentive
. Ameribor: ??? do we manage Ameribor growth or does AFX?

x add UVIX and SVIX to the code (probably needs 100M-200M AUM before contributing)
  x reevaluate with VXX - update soon
  - "I think it's all bad news from futures - not much has changed since you all last heard from me"
    - I have an updated version of the VXX effect spreadsheet I sent around late March - we now have 1 month of data after 3/14
  - just baffling - vega trading lost through VXX is NOT being replaced elsewhere
    - this is weird because ProShares's VIXY product is an exact clone, and yet people are not using it - it's like VXX disappeared and people just said
      "fine. I didn't want to trade vol anyway"
      - I would be very curious to chat with some institutional customers on how this figures into their vol strategy - *skip to bottom*
    - Volatility Shares's new as of 3/30 SVIX and UVIX ETPs are growing but a long way off
      - I have some numbers on hand (not sure which ones we care to hear), but they are definitely not
        "increasing their growth to replace the void" so to speak of VXX
      - basic numbers: comparing SVIX to mature 0.5x leverage inverse vol SVXY: 40x off; UVIX to mature 1.5x leveraged vol UVXY: 50x off, 30x to make up "lost"
        - long UVIX short SVIX to replicate VXX: 20MM volume to replace lost VXX
  . customer volume affected or no? their strategies tied to VXX vs. VIX?
    - Cube Research, Lorian, volumes almost nothing; Mark Chen at Millenium; Blue Diamond (for Morgan Stanley; also a TPH but trade through MS) a bit more complicated
    . would be very interested to chat with some of these guys - what are they doing now that their main vol strategy involving VXX is put on pause?
      - are they literally just not going to trade vol? is it that disposable?
      . check in with Hemal/Sarj
  - we are banking on Barclays getting some news on their shelf registration before issuing senior debt on 2022-04-28 before earnings on 4/29

- victor werny link for tableau sources
- luca salmon (?) extensive reporting on CFE market data, who is looking at data?
- albert can get document library for fees (siverson was looking at different types of TPHs)
- the 7 cents for reg fees doesn't go to Cboe and so doesn't go to RPC
- can ask Dave Stange
- Michael was probably changing customer % in iBoxx up to 30% by quarter
x ask Michael about Tableau dashboard with RPC
  - Charlie and Michael are thinking of the one requiring blackout permissions

*- finally learning Charlie's CFE Activity Dashboard (didn't happen until 2022-06-08)
  . ask how the checkmark to activate trade data works
  . ask Charlie why the hell they do  * (96 / 1)) / (96 / 1) to hack dates into INT
  . ask Charlie: MID([Flags],128,1) is related to GTH??
  . mid flags 13 A or R is Make/Take; ask Charlie about how these are decided at lowest level
  . what is "maturity calc" and "maturity" ranking it?
  - Charlie uses parameters to "show" and "hide" often
  - clever: Contras X Legs uses "description" to be the 1x because they all share description
  - "min date range" calculated field is clever but doesn't work with filters I think; uses "blank" field with LOD
  - there's a field for Q q being quote port vs. O . etc. being order port!
  - MTD Days clever: { FIXED MONTH([Trading Dt]),year([Trading Dt]):COUNTD([Trading Dt])}
  - kind of hacky clever way to get number of trade days from data: { exclude [Futures Root]:COUNTD([Trading Dt])}
  - "Date Level II" is the name of the "Timeframe" parameter
    - then "Date Value" has a case statement that chooses between pre-created days, weeks, months, quarters, years
      - days is (lmao): DATEPARSE ( "yyyyMMdd", STR((DATEPART('year', [dt])*10000 + DATEPART('month', [dt])*100 + DATEPART('day', [dt]))) )
      - months is without the day, etc.; very clever and hacky
      - quarters is also dateparsing a constructed string with only quarter and year info
      - week "ending" criterion field: truncate to week, add week, minus 2 days
    - "Timeframe" is then the precisely formatted string that looks like a standard date based on Date Level II and Date Value
      - this is the field put into column; adjusts with Date Value! clever

. send Julie Hinchey to Selina
  . send RPC once we find it
  . send ETP effects

- April/May 2020 was last time variance traded (Bloomberg active contract VAAA - VAAJ2 Index)
  - first 3 years of future is baby time, no rules
    - but after that, if no trades in a year, have to declare it dormant (by CFTC regulations)
  - license with DRW for methodology
  - waiting for OCC margins reevaluation
  - competitors cannot bring up anything with S&P 500
  - Arianne: I want to just delist this thing, but want to be respectful of DStrat's wishes to relaunch this thing eventually
  - Arianne: feel like DRW is probably referencing this thing internally for OTC variance, so let's have that call before taking it down

- 2022Q2 Revenue Forecast Prep
  - can you guys hear me? let me know if my microphone suddenly goes silent or something, I've had some major issues with it a few weeks back
  - okay I'm going to jump in on VIX futures
    - macro predictions were difficult because of rising Fed rates, Ukraine geopolitical stress, etc.
    - on top of that though, was the more immediate and separate effect of the Barclays VXX creation halt
      - I previously sent around a spreadsheet discussing how the loss of VXX volume, that is, fewer shares moving back and forth, meant decreased corresponding vega volume
        in VIX futures. this is the main impact - we estimated around 50k volume decrease in VIX futures
        - historically, ETP vega volume and VIX futures vega volume correlate extremely high
        - would be interesting to continue to track Volatility Shares's new products launched end of March, but obviously those need a lot of time before their AUM makes a difference
    - ask about talking more about 50k analysis
  - talk about customer share (capture) being stable
  - overall, expected decrease in volume, but stable capture in VIX; we have made changes through Q2 because of VXX
  - iBoxx

. do goals
. call HR

x Barclays
  x add SVIX/UVIX to my sheets
    . describe growth and potential effect - estimate how much volume we'd need before volume is "replaced" by Monday
  x update 96k chart from before
    x try to look at historical "ratio" or regression to justify 50k

. compare Parth/Charlie accounts info with what we had

- Jonathan/Irene: 250% increase in Interactive Brokers customers in GTH in options after 24/5
  - like 2400 to 8400 which is cool
- concentration risk of tons of volume being from just 2 firms

. Arianne: customer base change with move to quarterlies - due Wednesday
  . after Litch/Danny speak to MMs, have them estimate effect
  . I can then scale their monthly totals up or down correspondingly
    . I need to make a list of MMs with substantial volume (new format on monthly futures trends?)

. March futures trends

o Prime Trading Quarterlies Call
  - borrow costs for hedging are still there - not necessarily going to be better spread costs, just fewer rolls
  - sounds like Tom Kalaway is nervous about discrepancy between ETF and futures index, presumably because they use ETF to price and eat the small discrepancy
  - estimates 3 weeks before maturity for enforced roll

o DV Quarterlies Call
  - only Walter, and he doesn't have much experience with quarterlies
  *- my thoughts: bad thing about quarterlies is that MMs are NOT going to want to hold customer OI for 3 months
    - we know they price by literally holding HYG and praying the returns cancel exactly - diverging from HYG much easier over 3 months
    . question: we know you don't like to deal with pricing in the final week to maturity, because it's hard to gauge convergence to
      futures index; for this reason, we thought you might prefer quarterlies as well - less frequent rolling;
      do you see that as a positive - to have 1 week of craziness every 3 months vs. every 1 month? or is that outweighed by other factors?
      or would you prefer to extend that 1 week to multiple weeks if moving from monthlies to quarterlies?

o Mercury
  - spread would widen 3x maybe (yikes)
  - want roll to be incentivized again during roll period
    - we do have to restructure LMM program...
  - think will be good for users (optimistic)

o ARB Trading
  - hard to price if it's 3 months out
    - warning: may be worse for liquidity if it goes to quarterlies UNLESS 2-way flow
      - could widen, but more likely won't track the underlying as well (LOL)
      - holding the hedge is not margin efficient - basically MMs will have to skew the price more and more
  - we wouldn't try to make MMs make 3 months out contract - front month would be only one lit until roll (period to be decided)
  - believes volume and OI will go down (though we think differently because of customers coming in)
  - uh oh, ARB realized they may not be able to make money if we go to quarterlies (relative value on rolls?)
  - when would you be in the book? A: end of May at the earliest
  - options on futures: without robust underlying base to get rid of delta, hard sell

o MM Feedback Arianne Debrief
  - MMs are more amenable now - largely okay except Arb
  - market quality has diminished since Christmas, market itself less happy
    - HYG less premium - now flipping between premium/discount
    - also, borrow costs higher from no more QE
    - more volatile roll markets
    - now everyone is short! around Christmas they were long
  - that sets us up to current status; Union says market cannot handle what they want to put in as it exists currently
  - worst case scenario is clients coming right now and being put off
  - MM biggest concern is "do we need to quote 2nd quarter contract?" NO
  - how much harder and punitive in spreads is quoting quarterlies vs. monthlies?
    - Dennis: scope of difference in 3x reconstitution of futures index
    - Litch: one MM said wouldn't quite be 3x wide
  - basket rebalancing is twofold: Prime says 1) uncertainty in constituents - quarterly rebalanced index may help, but we pushed back;
  - Danny: proposed MM incentive reworking around rebalance, but Bob Siverson struck down data possibility of some of those ideas
  - Dennis: I trust Tom Kalaway
  - Danny: LMM program participants are chattering for more payment in 3rd and 4th place - not good
  - Litch and Danny: ARB seems to have more of an angle if they do come in in late May
  - Jim Adams margin offset still very important - Jane Street were so important in keeping things in line
    - Jane, Flow, ARB, etc. all have brought up how expensive the ETF margin is
  - SocGen would be streaming quotes from macro credit desk, but have ghosted us at the last step
    - Goldman, JP cannot do what they could do - would be so important

> ask Litch: are non-DV MMs comfortable holding OI during month

. email then put time on Charlie's calendar for explaining ETP analysis
  . ping Charlie about IBHY Daily Report data source updating just after midnight now
  . delete Mini Tools folder
  . random dashboard question - how to re-sort without losing white space
  x permissioning in US Futures Tableau
  x contra CTI from flags in CFE Order Fill with Reference data
  . ETP - discuss Charlie's dashboard, our work, data limitations?
  . ask about analytics layer if applicable?
o Meeting 2022-05-13
  - Snowflake migration lol
  - data source extract process is somehow delayed from 6pm to 1am, no guarantees for short term solution
    . adjust my iBoxx subscriptions, but no guarantee Snowflake won't just break it again if I try too timely
  - Charlie explains his dashboard is literal transaction fee revenues
    . chase him to add Barclays VXX revenue, even though it's not "perfect" with OI
    . explore that data source myself...
  - Charlie confirms ETP data is available off Bloomberg, understands the parameters of these dashboards!
    . check in with him as he says he'll make it

- 2019-10-07 was options migration

- to show up on CFTC's CoT, need at least 20 customer accounts trading 200 contracts each in a period, and SPIKES doesn't do that

o Parth CFE Account OI
  - officially revived - Andrew and co. will create and try to match with Parth
  - something about using analytics layer

x code for percentile ranks to fill out Futures Trends
> call Hemal ask about VXX institutional traders strategy changes
x do iBoxx margin work for Jim Adams
  - our tracking error is literally 
  x tracking error of other ETF vs. underlying index - must be pretty common for it to be above 6%
    x that also answers their next question
  x show tracking error of ETF vs. IBOXHY over history
  x tracking error between futures and futures index - it is almost certainly a word response for this one
    x other futures that cash-settle to the underlying index??? I don't even know of any - maybe E-minis?
  x show tracking error over history
  x explain iBoxx futures vs index correlation being low - the tricky part - use HYG as the answer...

- Bhaven Shah May 16; gone from June 30 to July 17 (back July 18)
  - main intern program is June 13 to August 12 (2 months)
  - Separately, administratively, are you planning to try working in-person in the Chicago office (as far as I know, it seems optional, but you would be welcome)?

- Bob Siverson, 2022-04-27: DPM (only DRW for Variance I think) being retired, now TPH is just LMM who does big % volume

x come up with Bhaven intern projects
  - part 0: read papers (VIX white paper), ask questions, discuss
  - main one is Tableau dashboards - have him learn, and then just give him one of the 9000 ideas we have?
    - great for familiarizing him with "what matters" in terms of futures business numbers and their root sources, but light on code
  - tie in part 2: Python-based Data Platform analytics layer work
    - I literally am just getting set up, so this would be very valuable - have Bhaven communicate with Andrew and Charlie and figure out details on Data Platform tools
      - ask him to dig into question: what's the best way for us to migrate existing Python code analyses into DP/Tablea/dashboard form?
  - tie in part 3: give him papers like Buzz Gregory 2014 and have him code up/dashboard up certain things; regression model, etc.
  - doing those things would really force him to learn so much of the business - I'm thinking back to when I first started learning about the futures business from scratch 1.5 years ago
    - basically being handed a piece of analysis and being told to update it and make it easier to use, and to write about it, is a great way to be forced to figure out what's important
  - script: hey, how are you doing? thanks for hopping on, I actually just used Whatsapp for the first time ever earlier today.
            it may immediately seem like a bit of a red flag though, that I'm NOT calling you from the work computer. that's because it is - 
            before I launch into that explanation though, how were finals? what's new?
            ----
            so you may have already heard from Arianne, but my boss Michael Mollet was fired from the company about a month ago, that's the cause for all this weirdness.
            the 2-minute explanation on what happened there is (and obviously we can and will be conversing a lot more about this topic) - iBoxx, the credit futures
            product that we probably spoke on and on about during interview, has been costing Cboe a lot of money in incentive programs - we pay MMs to keep up
            liquidity. in the grand scheme of things, it is still a young product with a lot of potential, but exec sees it as a big leech. us spending all our time
            + refusing VIX = scapegoat during the VXX fiasco.
            ---- does that all make sense so far?
            so basically, we are kind of butting heads with Arianne - she wants us to go in a completely different direction from what Michael Mollet and I

. show Arianne mini dashboards

o Michael Convo 2022-04-27
  - why VXX volume not replaced by VIXY?
    A: Barclays is able to give borrow rates to MMs for create-to-lend - MMs want to short, and Barclays is the place to go
      - in our previous convo with ProShares, they said they can't offer (or guarantee) borrow
        - their borrow is all over the place
        - people are having to create-to-lend with a box combo (?)
        - tried to get bank friends to do create-to-lend for them, but bank would have to short index, lend ETF, which is tough
    A: move to OTC with bank instead, then bank reporting as CTI 2? check if Goldman volumes are changing?
  - in similar vein, Susq was biggest holder of VXX - check changes in their behavior - are they now just replicating themselves? they could easily do it
  - check Citadel
  x work with Siverson on VIX fee structure - can squeeze more out of fee-agnostic banks, but not HFT like Eagle Seven; be VERY CAREFUL of Jump, whose classification
    may end up looking like a bank, but are VERY fee-sensitive
    - basically combine CTI code (currently only using that to bill) with TPH designation (broker-dealer CTI 2 is almost certainly strategies with VIX, etc.)
  - need better awareness of who is what CTI mainly, where are they located, etc.
    - we know where the prop groups are, but location of customers would be useful
  - may not be entirely accurate at first - not set up yet, ask Siverson
    - JPM said a lot of volume coming out of China, we haven't seen that yet
  - may be able to identify with OEOIDs and locations

> do VIX volumes breakdown for futures trends over weekend
x need to add expandable/collapsible sections to futures trends and figure out better way to include "color"
. embed positioning OI per account info into futures trends

- IBHY Goldman account C0709725 250 in Feb, 500 in Mar is Mediolanum, Irish account
  - unfortunately they closed out, but we know they have $100MM TRS rolling in June that Litch is targeting

x Ken Hill updated ETPs

x when talking to Hemal, ask about Michael's customer identification spreadsheet, ask about Lorian, Cube, Millennium
  - is that a pretty standard thing you guys do though, I mean outside of Michael mentally keeping tally and Litch keeping his iBoxx customers spreadsheet,
    do you and Sarj try to keep track of account numbers tied to customers?
    - because if so, a few months ago I was planning out a system with Johnny from Salesforce - it's called Tag1s, where everyone starts tagging

x check VXM revenue potential from the FCST spreadsheet - how many million is the target? (before discussing with Arianne about the incentive program)

x ping Eileen about old "day trading" incentive program - start date, end date, etc. to figure out customer base changes

- TYVIX CTD MD process
  - read deliverybaskets for futures month, tenor, cusip, rate, maturity, security type, term, original term, remaining term, conversion factor
  - read optionsfuturesschedule for relevant futures maturities
  - evaluate current time's CTD bond by using 1) futures price, 2) bond price to calculate implied repo rate for each bond
    - max IRR for each tenor future is CTD
    . we should record this somewhere maybe
      - the reason we haven't is that Bloomberg has HCTD (though that doesn't have prices)
      - note I used to manually pull HCTD; see C:/Users/gzhang/OneDrive - CBOE/Gaibo/TYVIX/Basis Point Conversion/Treasury VIX/
        - public version of that folder is P:/ProductDevelopment/Products/CME Tsy VIX/Documentation/Basis Point Vol Documentation/HCTD Modified Durations/
        - it was originally developed for shared use on the shared Bloomberg Terminal
  - calculate MD for these CTD bonds using price/yield, rate, maturity

o Danny Jisa project: former futures incentive program "day trading" vs. current tiers
  - ran through 2018-11; no wonder I never heard of it
  - got data from 2018-02 to present, Thomas Mueller said something about asking for access to "invoice_rows", all invoiced lines

. I should add a close-to-close percentile to Index OHLC!

- note 2022-05-09 for Futures Trends iBoxx - RJO uses an omnibus account for HillTop and AM West, so those guys prob shouldn't make it onto top customers write-up

x resuscitate Block ECRP Dashboard from Futures Sandbox lol
  - bug: CFE Order Fill's contra and contra_clearing are duplicate in block/ECRP trades (work correctly on outrights and spreads)
    - example: exec_id 110002WBU for normal, 110003J4G for bad ECRP
  x add operator ID lmao
- philosophy: one well-designed dashboard, one raw data sheet in case user wants to download and explore via Pivot Table
[2:33 PM] Barrett, Charlie
So the way I think of it is below:
firm_id = Member firm getting the order into Cboe's system
firm_sub_id = The logical port that the firm_id sent the order over
on_behalf_of = Member firm that originated the order which they passed to the firm_id (which may or may not be the same as the firm_id)
  - clearing_firm = Relates to the on_behalf_of and holds the details that will clear the trade ie occ #. Generally thought of as a business line of the on_behalf_of.
    Example: MSCO acting as an on_behalf_of has two clearing_firms: RFBT and MRGS
  - parent_clearing_firm: So if each clearing_firm has an occ # parent_clearing_firm identifies who owns the occ #.
    Example: parent_clearing_firm BCAP (Barclays) owns the occ # 704 they have relationships with any clearing firm which is in effect the on_behalf_of that uses the occ # 704

- VIX hours changed to
  - 8:30am to 3pm RTH
  - 3pm to 4pm; 5pm to 8:30am ETH
  - Specifically:
    - 8:30am-3pm US
    - 3pm-4pm Curb
    - 5pm-2am Asian
    - 2am-8:30am European
  . test in a more developed dashboard for errors and 4pm-5pm trades

x night work - finally finish the Futures Trends write-up
x email Bhaven from Yahoo
x email Charlie ETP info and set up meeting
  . follow-up on progress?
x set up call with Hemal

x examine Charlie and Parth's new ETP work 2022-04 (and create one-off dashboards)
  - ProShares
    - Parth: PROTOP, PROSHARESTOP, 8580A, PSI8000, 00PSM, 24E67, ABUPROSH
    - Charlie: CALPSPROE, UBS-PSTBA, PSI8000 IS NOT
    - combined: PROTOP, PROSHARESTOP, 8580A, 00PSM, 24E67, ABUPROSH, CALPSPROE, UBS-PSTBA
  - Barclays VXX
    - Parth: L.XBL.10265
    - Michael Mollet: LXBL10265, L10265
    - combined: those 2 but with every variation on capitalization and anything including 10265
  - Volatility Shares
    - VSFTOP (for both SVIX and UVIX)
  . create parameters on revamped CFE Activity Dashboard that can adjust between these 3???

- Hemal: before changing VIX fee structure, should try a fee holiday first to see what the effect is (and who joins)
  - going to pennies just lets HFT fill in gaps, but it will immediately retract when volume moves
  - concern on VIX going pennies: when VIX moves, it moves BIG

. tell Arianne: Bob Siverson VXM vs. VIX GTH work

o Ashley Turnbull 2022-09-07
  x call HR to ask about Cboe matching vesting - my hire date as an intern with matching technically was 2017-06...
    - will check and get back to me
  x also, if I was to lose my job, would I retain health insurance until next open enrollment?
    - Cboe plan to end of quitting month, Cobra plan for like a year or something
  x PTO if I am terminated?
    - will be paid out at salary rate; though technically can't extend last day using PTO

o Hemal sent the VIX accounts spreadsheet; apparently he and Michael have been keeping it together
  - Qube is a bust for VXX - their volumes have not changed
    - quantitative research, do options too, not specific to VXX apparently
  . Hemal confirming for Laurion and Mark Chen/Millennium - I need to look at numbers
  - Hemal knows Ousmane Diop/Capstone and a couple others - check call reports
    - Capstone relative value
  . send Hemal Litch OneDrive link and ask for similar

- 2022-05-13 Week Review
  - wrapped up revision of iBoxx RBH stuff with Jim Adams
  - helped out Danny in DStrat with BAML index reconciliation using BBG SPX options quotes
  - finalized new formatting on monthly futures trends
  - general Tableau learning - created new Block Dashboard, worked on a couple others in mini-tools collection
    - really trying to dig into one particular data source - Annapurna's time-weighted average liquidity
      - the VXM incentive work with Bob Siverson will be made from this
  - VXM vs. VX GTH liquidity work with Bob Siverson
  - last week Danny Jisa - wants to look at day trading incentive program - sent over small dataset, haven't dug into it yet, haven't followed up
  - talking to Charlie Barrett about converting ETP analyses to dashboards
  - VIXTLT - files held up internally because I don't have the specific FTP access - working with Rebecca Carter and Mike Durkin
  - Andrew Paulman and Parth OI positions per account - crucial for dashboarding; trying to get set up on analytics layer (also for Bhaven)
  - reached out to Hemal, have info on VIX account numbers vs. customers - I set up Tag1 system with Johnny Pesenti a month ago, Hemal and
    team are interested in trying that out, so I will try to pursue that
  - reached out to Bhaven, said I was available for questions, he was asking me to send him some resources to study up in preparation for
    starting since he would be doing a couple weeks less
    . for sure get Michael Shea's team's input

. Scott Manziano - YTD perspective - maybe that into monthly futures trends
  . QoQ
  . Scott would like OI position per account

. 2022-05-16: test "on extract refresh" until Snowflake to see effect - only my IBIG has been left on extract refresh

. Scott Manziano - Book2.xlsx - add this "revenue-based, upward-reporting" segment to futures trends
  - step 1: frame volume in this v boring way of YoY $, etc.
    - step 1a: somehow incorporate the forecasted revenue numbers lmao
  - step 2: incorporate realized revenue

o Andrew Paulman - setting up analytics layer
  - ssh-keygen -t rsa will overwrite previous SSH key, very clean, no duplicates; just have to put new one into Bitbucket
  - my password is better
  - startAgent, git clone danda
  - Terminal: psql gzhangdb to access Postgres (our preferred database system for personal databases in analytics layer)
    - can directly put stuff like "select * from test" into PSQL (assuming "test" is a table we saved from Analytics Layer API)
    - \dt is the industry standard PSQL command for showing all the tables btw - can Google more I'm sure
  - Andrew ran through some examples with me of the API:
from danda.query import dbQuery as dbq
from danda.query import postgresUtil as pu
dbq.runQueryWithTiming("select * from options_us.order_summary limit 10")
pu.saveDataFrameAsTable(df, 'test')
pu.getTablesInDatabase() 	# Comparable to \dt in PSQL
  - Annapurna and Julie Hinchey for turning tables into data sources
  - Andrew for automation
    - workflow is eventually batch for permanent
  - can drag and drop my code into the Linux container! (nccdpa01.us.cboe.net?)
    - no restrictions from EUC on what we can install!
  *- runQueryMultiDay() very useful for running same query on a bunch of days using threading!
    . revive old project of VIX settlement VWAP plotting - maybe even use plot.ly!

. Arianne: 2022-05-18
  . ask Litch about iBoxx LMM program edits
    - main reason for LMM is 1) volume front for customers to be comfortable
      - the next goals are 2) open interest (incentive program doesn't help this, this is a next step), 3) screen liquidity
    - Litch list of customers that have explicitly been pulled over the line by good volumes: 
    . last resort bargaining chip: if you want to see what happens with cutting an incentive program, pause IBIG's; that'll cut down on the negative capture for now
  . do GTH VXM comparison
    x read the documents
    x todo: add bid and ask size comparisons in addition to spreads!
    . todo: add volumes next to the liquidity to see effect!
      . get Annapurna to add this to this data source!
        . also, ask about per TPH (firm) or per EFID?
    x todo: add lifetime of contract liquidity (bid size, ask size, spread)
    - now I wanted to ask about conversations you have had with IB and TD and tastyworks about what the prospective customer base is like
      - customer volume is 50% from IB, so it seems like mostly former financial professionals
        . would be great to know foreign interest vs. US (we now have the tools!)
      - well to me, from these charts, it doesn't seem like liqudity is the issue - when liquidity is relatively bad in GTH, we're getting solid volume growth
        - numbers wise, we have 1500-2000 unique accounts trading every month, but they're only trading 2000-3500 contracts - 1 or 2 contracts per account per month
          - considering that use-case, I don't think better liquidity will make these guys trade more than 1 or 2 contracts per month
    . volume mix during times of the day
      . speak to Annapurna about what we can get from the data - need to identify TPHs, potentially get "cost per contract" each TPH is paying (batch team with Bob
        may be doing these calculations, but surely there's a way for DNA team to get it?
    . 1) Arianne: which LMMs have fallen away?
    . 2) reach out to Bob - figure out who's getting paid and how much?
      . does he have exact numbers on what each TPH's "cost per contract" ends up being? that seems like a very important number, and with the tier program
        they literally don't know themselves until the end of the month
      . "how far off" are the LMMs who don't make it (most of them don't even make the basic Volume Incentive Pools)?
      . separately, I need to ask Michael about Bob's bank fees project
    x 3) Danny: pain points for the LMMs who have fallen off?
      - basically no one is making the incentive program lol
      - problem for a lot of people appears to be their speed cannot compete
      . check the spreadsheet for exactly what's up

- Annapurna's CFE TOB Market Quality Summary data source - finally using it
  - Time Calc group is the very interesting function:
    1) separate integer part of time and decimal (float(time) modulo 1) part of time (integer part is days)
    2) do to decimal part: multiply by 12, round, divide by 12 (this cleverly rounds to nearest 2-hour segment; obviously can modify to 6 for 4-hour, etc.)
    3) recombine to round datetime to nearest x-hour segment!
    - fun fact here: formula FLOAT([time interval new])%1 * 12 will yield 0 to 11, BUT take off the *12 and Tableau will incorrectly tell you it's all 0
      - somehow, Tableau is unable to show the decimals there!
    *- oh LMAO do NOT use this field - it is non-deterministic on the edge cases:
      30 minute Custom Time Calc on 15-minute data source: 8:30(8:30), 8:45(9), 9(9), 9:15(9), 9:30(9:30), 9:45(10), 10(10), 10:15(10:30)
      - cannot be fixed with adjusting rounding to up or down...
  - as far as VIX data goes, "time interval" and "time interval new" are the exact same!
  . no way to distinguish TAS! ask Annapurna to add "Product Type" from Order Fill!
  *- duration_type eliminating Weeklies is very important!
    - I initially thought I needed to use Median because Average was getting pulled way up by spikes, but that is wrong! it was just Weeklies lmao

- iBoxx: Litch asking APs and banks about changing maturity date to 20th like IMM dates
  - Dennis: modify options to European exercise into both near-term and next-term (mid-curve);
            if moving away from reconstitution date, no need to take futures final settle date
    - all CME FX OOF have moved from American to European; American is difficult for MMs
    - CANNOT do European with back-to-back settlement (options into futures into cash), prohibited in CFTC world
  - Litch: hear point about moving away from American, but early exercise risk would be negligible and we need back-to-back settlement
    - additional minefield is that credit desks price futures and equity desks would price the options
    - what about options on IBXXIBHY, futures on IBXXIBHY? no reasonable way to trade an April option (would be hedged with Jun futs)
    - also, try to connect this to the TAS-esque possibility to allow trading basis to the index (ideally ETF NAV)
    - 4 years from 2023 to 2026, 3rd Friday is on or before 20th 41 times, vs. not 7 times (can expire into 20th of month expiry futures)

o Danny Day Trading Project
  . heatmap for Danny on the VX and VXM per firm

- VXM LMM notes (7 notable guys in 2022-05):
  - Jump literally reporting wrong EFID and showing 0% - that's how much they don't care
  - Budo, Headlands trading very small time not close to VIP
  - Eagle Seven, SpireX, Jane Street making VIP but not close to QQI
  - Rigel Cove making QQI and taking 100% RTH and GTH!
  - Bob has incredible spreadsheet on this:
    RTH: up through Feb:
      Jane (main - 23k/37.5k RTH), SpireX (12k/37.5k), Rigel (scraps... until 2022-03 at which point the others dropped!)
      - this is very weird - Jane doesn't seem to care that it lost $22k of steady money when it dropped out in Mar, same for SpireX
        - be very skeptical of what Rigel says about keeping the current program - they randomly got a boost of $35k starting 2022-03!
    GTH: up to Dec, it was SpireX over half, Rigel under half; then Rigel full in Jan and both out in Feb
      - important: an increase in $7k+ incentive was not enough to keep Rigel quoting to these standards! the money did nothing
        - on the flip side, a loss of $11k was not enough to deter SpireX from leaving in 2022-01
  . question now is:
    1) did GTH quality get worse NOT REALLY
      . in 2021-09 when Jump dropped out?
      . in 2022-01 when SpireX dropped out?
      . in 2022-02 when Rigel finally dropped out?
    2) did RTH quality get worse
      . in 2021-08 when Jump dropped out?
        - actually yes, a little, both in spread and bid/ask size! BUT this has since recovered - JUMA to JUMK
      . in 2022-03 when Jane and SpireX dropped out?
  - also histogram on customer behaviors: surprising volume from the 1%, who are not "normal people"
    - however, spot checking a couple of those guys, the per-trade amount is still just a couple contracts!
      - the 2 biggest guys (JPM, DB) by far literally do HFT with 1-2 per trade; then IB/TradeStation/StoneX guys doing 50 contracts per trade
        - 50 to 100 is the max we'll see from a single guy at a time, and there are literally only a handful (~10) of those guys in existence
      - I really should have better data, but some Data Platform resources are malfunctioning; may have to do with Snowflake migration
  - narrative:
    1) what do VXM retail customers need in order to trade? short answer - max 50-100  bid/ask size, decent spreads near 5 cents
      - show histogram (quick overview of customer habits)
        - find above section
      - do we have enough liquidity for this? yes
        - show VXM GTH liquidity dashboard
    2) now has liquidity historically been affected when firms dropped out?
      - not really - Jump had a temporary effect when they dropped out in 2021-08
    3) mention that you believe going to pennies won't really affect this. mention wanting to confer with Bob and especially Danny on these claims
. ping Arianne and give her the brief on iBoxx incentive program and why it's not the same - MMs there actually care, and customers need it for confidence

. wait who was responsible for insane bid/ask sizes in VX mid 2021-10 to mid 2021-11? back up to 500 from 250, right back down after
  - SPX had just resumed a steep climb after faltering; 2021-10-20 was the TAS event; people were thinking COVID was done, and this was right before Fed rhetoric

*- VIXTLT big breakthrough! the files in the FTP are suitable!!!
  . need to work closely with Matt Bukowski, Durkin, Dennis, Tiago, Brian Eck to finally ship this thing
    . step 1: work out way with Durkin to empirically test when these files update
  . inform Dennis and Tiago about this; lay out what happens once I get the files into P:\ProductDevelopment\Database\sftp_transfers\
    . edit the Jira page!
  - okay cf_analytics_ISHARES_AMRS_20220401.csv file is also useful! I can match their ACF ETF yield and modified duration exactly using their price!
    although their "file date" is the trade date, i.e. 4/1 file date means their price is close of 4/1; so use different day from "as of" dates
  - something called fund PAR is in the other unique CSV file in the tar.gz
  - so the formatting is AMRS (Americas?), CAD, EMEA, LAT; ISHARES_AMRS_CF_yyyymmdd.tar.gz
    - each of those files opens into ~206 CSVs: 102 ETFs (maturity vs. worst) and then the 2 unique summary CSVs
[ecnuser@ncc4r35 ~]$ sftp -o ConnectTimeout=2 -i /home/ecnuser/.ssh/id_rsa_legacy_ecnuser_cboescp_2048 generftp@ftp.blackrock.com
Connected to ftp.blackrock.com.
sftp>
o Matt Bukowski: talks very fast in low voice, easy to miss words
  - basically ncc4r35 is a new thing that replaces edeepfrz
  - Tiago and I can set up CHRStudio xfer_sftp_win.py to automate transfer to those "Windows share folders" i.e. P drive sftp/ folder!
  - Matt set me up to access ncc4r35
    - first had me remote control his computer and create SSH keys (password b w y u), gave me private
    - I put private into OneDrive/Import/SFTP and setup WinSCP
      - hostname ncc4r35, username dstrat, no password
      - Advanced: 1) SSH->Authentication add private key (auto-converts into putty format from OpenSSH);
                  2) Connection->Tunnel hostname lxlc-jump05 username gzhang (my Linux credentials), no password
      - pressing login then requires that I type 3 (!) authentications: 1) RSA token from my phone app, 2) Linux password (@B w y u0!), 3) SSH key password (b w y u)
  - note to self: can reset Linux container password by typing kinit (Kerberos init)
  - note to self: because production systems have weekly sprints to implement any changes, my public key actually won't permanently be registered for a week
    - Matt was able to put it in temporarily, but it gets wiped before it's permanently added in the weekly

o Hunter Treschl Tag1 Meeting
  - figured out they ended up tagging affiliated clearing firm to the IDs!
  x send Hunter clearer version of "Fuzzy Salesforce Customer Account Name" vs. "Trading Account Number to Tag"
  - draft sentence: uh, it's another guy using DV's systems trading independently from the main 2 guys who run DV;
                    IDK if this guy would be noted separately in Salesforce

x edit Index OHLC dashboard - tooltip is showing whole numbers without decimals (useless for VIX)
  - oh god damn it, someone changed the data source so that's why things are broken. my filters are gone too
  - turns out right-click "replace references" is an easy fix to the new data source field names
  - looks like with Snowflake migration, as of 2022-05-27 Historical Index Values is gone! Proprietary Index OHLC is still here

- Optiver vs. CTC and Citadel toxicity in XSP

- Bhaven call prep:
  - so formally, officially, welcome to your internship with the Cboe Futures business, AKA CFE (Cboe Futures Exchange)
    - we are a team of 1 person (me) who is formerly a researcher who now has become a data rat (despite not being very good at finding data in our new Data Platform)
      - I then try to provide data and analysis to the other tangential members of the Derivatives hierarchy
        - at the top is Arianne, head of Derivatives
        - under her at present branching towards us is 1) Bob Siverson (very experienced in low level details especially in billing), and 2) Danny Jisa (head of sales team)
        - branching away from us is 1) Michael Shea (head of options) who has 2 fresh out of college hires Jonathan Zaionz and Irene Zou
      - completely separate from us, I want you to also be aware of the Derivatives Strategy team, my former home which is now falling apart fast
        - John Hiatt (VIX god)
        - Dennis O'Callahan (product development head)
        - Tiago Silva (product development senior guy with all the low level/code details)
        - Parth Shah and Danny Kipnis
      - I will send you a diagram so you can refer to this often; I am spending quite a bit of time here because being remote, we feel so isolated,
        but I want you to know every single person on this list is very much flesh and blood and will respond to you in a very friendly way, especially the younger guys
----
  - so the way I want to structure checking in with you at the outset is to give you tiny slices of information that I consider to be important
    - my hope is that you'll read that small slice of information and you'll be like, "what does this word mean? I kind of know what this word means, but why do we care?"
      - what my boss did for me in the very beginning that I found extremely helpful was that we had a couple of 30 minute conversations where we just went on tangents
        and I basically asked about any and everything I didn't have 100% clarity on, while he tried to lecture me about what matters to the Futures business
    - the reason I want to do it like this is that 1) I want to figure out where your comfort zone is at the moment, 2) I want to transfer to you information specific to Futures
      - does that sound alright?
----
Derivatives
- Arianne Adams (Criqui), head of Derivatives
  - under her at present branching towards us is
    1) Bob Siverson (low level product details - billing, specs, etc.)
    2) Danny Jisa (head of sales team that speaks to market makers about products)
  - branching away from us in options is
    1) Michael Shea (head of options)
      - who has 2 fresh out of college hires
        1) Jonathan Zaionz
        2) Irene Zou
Completely separate from us, I want you to also be aware of the Derivatives Strategy team (my former team, just renamed):
- John Hiatt (VIX god) and Dennis O'Callahan (product development head)
- Tiago Silva (product development senior guy with all the low level/code details)
- Parth Shah and Danny Kipnis (experienced researchers my age - we can meet and chat with them regularly in Chicago office)

x do VXX stats before morning call

- 2-4 Minute May or YTD Volumes Options and Futures Businesses Summary
  - during the month of May, S&P bounced up and down non-stop (here's a Bloomberg chart with VIX overlayed on it)
    - you can see 1 2 3 4 5 peaks/troughs in VIX as it bounces between 25 and 35
  - there is so much disagreement in the market - basically the first (biggest) S&P peak/VIX trough was the 50bp rate hike, then after it was just reverberations
    objecting to that
    - this is the best time for organic VIX volume - we haven't seen a month this organic in a long time
  - here's my Futures Trends page, on it there is a stats table for each product with color highlighting and bold text to emphasize what I think are the interesting points
    - looking at the VIX one - our ADV was 240k, and this ranks it as 4th out of the last 12 months; that doesn't sound that impressive, but look down at TAS
      - the crucial piece of story there is two-fold: 1) VIX ETPs in general lost AUM (and correspondingly, roll volume) big time, 2) VXX's death still looms;
        here's the takeaway: 240k is a very high volume number (year of 2021 ADV was 215k; that's what we would compare to as "budget"),
                             but don't let it distract you from how big of an effect VXX is still having - we'll look at the numbers in 2 minutes but if VXX was still alive,
                             we'd be seeing closer to 300k ADV in VIX, which goes from healthy to historic (I think that would be easily highest since 2020-03)
        - let's scroll to the bottom: here we can look at how customer volume has changed from the top TPHs
          - everyone tanked in March with Russian war news, and they've been "recovering" differently in April and May
            - notice that most months, VIX ETP roll volume (which counts as "customer") dominates overall volume trends; NOT the case this month (highlight; look at...)
      - now to close on the topic of VIX ETPs, let's touch briefly on VXX - as I mentioned earlier, volume is so organically good that it makes you forget how it could
        be better with VXX - glancing at this chart - in similar times of stress, we see 60k-70k VIX-equivalent contract volume from VXX, 100k from UVXY (scroll)
        - like I said before, we'd be sniffing 280k-300k ADV if this product was still here
        - while we're here, final shoutout to the Volatilty Shares ETPs - doing pretty well
  - that's it for me on the VIX, time's up, but quick note on iBoxx - highest active customers ever, customer records in IBIG

- July Volume Update
  - Bloomberg chart
  - highlighted volumes
  - message is very simple with context: not much has happened since May
    - last time I spoke here in May, I noted a lot of "organic"
    - that activity died out in final week of May, and low volumes have continued through most of June and through ALL of July
      - June did have the futures volume benefit of what happened mid-month with the FOMC meeting - literally 2 days before on Monday, huge inflation
        panic suddenly happened and Fed suddenly announced the 75bp hike, so there was HUGE volatility and volume for 3 days
  - Danny Jisa wants minor update on UVIX/SVXY growth
    . I should make a new VXX Effect spreadsheet as of 2022-07-29
    - but briefly UVIX is still growing well, 2x AUM in July, 40% increase in ADV from June
      - SVIX plateaued in early May though (obviously volume and AUM big throughout high vol May, but afterwards dropped back to early May level on both)

x Wolverine TAS death WOW
  - from Jenn Fortino's call report: officially exiting TAS market making in 2022-06, but volumes had dropped off by 2021-12
    - basically nothing since 2022-03, so not a huge change
    - reason is just determinism made it so Wolverine couldn't compete even after spending money,
      and they are convinced the current winners are gaming the system somehow; very unhappy
  x once my maker/taker dashboard is up, maybe worth looking at who all took the maker volume from Wolverine with determinism
    - recall that 2021-06-06 was the BOEv3 migration to determinism
    - historically in VX TAS market making:
      - back in early 2018: Eagle7, Virtu, Katana, IMC, Laurion
      - then in 2018-08, XR come in
      - then in 2019-04, Wolverine are big
      - Virtu leave in 2019-10 (or transition to Virtu Americas, which leave after 2020-03);
        IMC and Laurion don't come back after 2020-03;
        Katana leave as of 2021-02
      - PNT Financial come in big in 2021-11
    - the big guys currently are: XR, Eagle7 (constant throughout history), Wolverine, and PNT
      - Wolverine dropping out leaves basically just XR (50%-75%) and Eagle7
        - no real suggestion that TAS trading is affected yet, but that can't be good for market depth in times of crises

. figure out the old data system used to track Day Trading
  - Danny makes it sound like it was very different from TPH-CTI tracking system
  . look into Eurodollar incentive program
    - apparently "day trading" program is common terminology in other exchanges as well
  x ask Eileen or someone who's been there for a while about the old data system
    - asked Thomas Mueller
  - from Danny's description it sounds like the overall goal is to cut per-contract cost flat out to churn volume
    - any volume increase will be from the guys who go home flat, like Clear who supposedly used to do 100k a month
  . ping Eileen for pre-2018-02 data because Thomas Mueller doesn't have it

x 2022-05 VXX analysis

x call Annapurna about Day Trade data format
x put meeting on Bhaven's calendar
  x mention Juneteenth btw
x email Eileen about Day Trading

- likely 2022-08-01 for VXM to pennies
- 75 bps interest rate rise happened on 2022-06-15
  - rates (bonds, futures, swaps 3-legged stool) have lost correlation recently
- Total/Serviceable Attainable Market (TAM, SAM, SAAM)
- can ask John Hiatt about projecting revenues
- options on 2 mid-curve VIX futures would replicate options on VXX (front 2 months)
  - cheaper for institutional

x ask Bob what happened

x call Bhaven briefly to lay out VIXTLT names
. schedule huge chunk of time in person to go over Data Platform
. ping Matt Bukowski
. write up script to talk to Dennis and Tiago, after updating the Jira page finally!
  . which pieces of code do I have to revisit before shipping off to Brian Eck's team?

x update the budget forecast
  x use CTI customer share - is it realistic to keep RPC or tweak up or down?
    - VIX: exact same as before - CTI 4 share is constant, use historical 1.80
  x use graphical changes - does macro change anything about volume expectations?
    - VIX: actually no - despite great volume with Fed announcement of 50bp rises in late April, things shut down in mid May and only spiked for
           the 2 days of speculation before the 75bp rise in mid June; graphically, there is still a baseline since mid March VXX loss,
           punctuated by just one period of volatility that now likely will not repeat, as the Fed may be out of surprises
  x write notes for our methodology - look at VXX dropoff, take average of Q2 to normalize for rates vol
----
x VIX: see above
  - ADV: maintain the dropped 50k for VXX
  - RPC: stay the course because customer volume share remains stable (after being elevated for 4 quarters after 2020-03)
x VIX Weekly: analogous logic to big VIX
  - ADV: down from past couple years, so we can attribute this to 2022 regime - scale last year's total ADV down by Q2 decrease
  - RPC: average Q1 RPC
x Mini VIX: analogous logic to big VIX, but can't "stay the course" because it's a growing product
  - ADV: previously dropped to 10k for VXX and MM impact from VXX in big VIX
  - RPC: average Q1 RPC
x IBHY: previously set up for 3500 ADV in Q4, scaling down a bit now
  - ADV: 20% growth each month still sets us up for 3500 ADV in Q4, but it's been scaled down given Q2 realized volume
  - RPC: using those ADV numbers, from scratch formula with $125,000 monthly incentive, assuming customer share growth to boost RPC
x IBIG: analogous method to IBHY
  - ADV: 12.5% growth each month, as before
  - RPC: using ADV, formula with $50,000 monthly incentive, assuming customer share growth to boost RPC
----
x for next quarter
x send to finance team - David Zaccaro, Brittany Carter, Stephen Bolton

x options on futures revenue estimate
  x in modeling iBoxx opportunities, ask Litch for his and Michael's revenue estimates as reference
  . make sure Litch sends the refreshed numbers

o Going to pennies
  - floor traders are PISSED because they heard about this through legal filing lmao
  - Anthony Montesano has put together plan for series of 1-on-1 talks - don't want them to gang up on us
  - Anthony mentioned someone's already complained about potential loss of executable size
    - but most banks seem fine with it
  - options "combo" is other name for synthetic future - think about arbitrage between that and futures (futures are probably much cheaper from fees)
  - talking points:
    1) VIX revamp to stimulate product
    2) we file rules for flexibility, approval came quicker than we thought
    3) reached out to some TPHs, feedback was positive
      - Arianne acknowledges it's not "overwhelmingly" positive
      - Anthony wants the crowd to hear the Street thinks they provide no value (it's not an insult, just want them to know reputation at stake)
      - Double D usually critical of our MMs, but defends them and is very against the tick reduction - it's never turned out well
    4) we'll show up with data to show executions won't be blocked

x Bhaven Dan Salmon
x send Bhaven DP Python API code

- 2022-06-27 IBHY and IBIG: for first time ever, printed volume across all 8 listed contracts! July through October

o Thomas Mueller (Makeup Notes)
  - RateType "Basis Point" is old name for 2018-02 and 2018-03 and then they switched to "Fee Based" but it's same thing
    - QB is QuickBooks which is also just a format change
  - TRAN FEE ADJUSTMENTS is synonymous with Irregular Description
    - all happened on 2018-06-29 (most) or 2018-04-30 (SPRX 2 lines for Feb and March)
    - shares could actually be 0??? for 2018-02 for Jump and XTXX
  - there are 2 rows in Regular Description which are CreditMemo instead of Invoice
    - CNTK and Headlands 2018-06-29, signs are reversed on volume - it's negative, so is it some kind of payment adjustment??
      . all CreditMemos are for CNTK and Headlands - what on earth?
  - Thomas's "shares/contracts reflected in line's rebate" number is frequently 10% more OR 40% less than the "volume"/applicable base fees number
    x why the hell
      - seems to correspond with fee codes: XN = same, XC = +40%, XP = -10%
Questions for Thomas:
1) CreditMemo? "volume" field is negative instead of positive
  - CNTK and Headlands - what happened and why did they get so many CreditMemos?
x) fee codes - where do I get more info on this?
  - https://www.cboe.com/us/futures/membership/fee_schedule/?feedate=2018-06-13
    - XN = non-Cboe TPH $1; XC = customer $1.40; XP = Cboe TPH $0.90; all 3 are VX
      -  that explains the percentages - they are literal dollar amounts, and the XN just happens to correspond to $1 per contract
Thomas Messages Summary:
  - line_amount is exact and actual rebate with correct sign!
  - quantity of 1 in column H (item_count) + desc of Day Trade are manual adjustments after the fact for first few months after migration
    - CAN'T get the contract counts at all here
    - amount entered is usually the adjustment total amount
    - that 1 is the "number of whole dollars of fees on which they got the rebate", not contract count
    - first of those 2 agg values "Total Agg" is the contract count (not volume) and NOT sign-reversed
  - TRAN FEE for manual adjustments!
  - "credit memo" is not accurate because the invoice no doubt had several other lines in it, and all lines together make up the invoice total
    - if invoice total is less than 0, all lines for invoice go on credit memo (WorkDay file)
  - 2 columns on WorkDay file are flipped: volume and line_amount (LMAO)
  - item_count is the relevant dollars to within $1, line_amount is the actual amount; "price" is also line_amount rounded to 2 places (? lmao)
  - price/volume is 0.45 in all cases
    - the other stuff is for invoice - not the price, but the notional; % of FEES (not notional) is the rate; volume is not contracts but rather fee to take % of
  - Total Agg: # shares/contracts reflected in line's fee/rebate
  - Adjusted Agg: notional size*price reflected by those shares
  - Invoice Total: net total of all lines for that invoice (UNUSABLE because multiple lines summed)
  - Invoice Shares: I assume similar to above, UNUSABLE
- notes: ADV in Tableau:
  1) get full calendar days with Charlie's EXCLUDE method
  2) count number of unique calendar days
  3) divide sum of size by distinct count
. note that for Day Trade, you literally have to have closed out - look at buy AND sell
  - also, subtract the 20k threshold!
  - indiscriminate of Cboe TPH, non-Cboe TPH, customer; don't filter CTI
. note that for Tier Rebate, it includes everything - TAS, Block/ECRP, Weeklies
  - only non-CTI 4, rebate on all volume, not just "over threshold"
  - ah instead of per account, we're talking per EFID
- I don't think it's possible to do LOD on daily per-contract BS cancelling... unless
  - one field just B, one field just S
  - one field min of B and S
  - one field that fixes year-month-day of that field
  - one field that fixes year-month and sums that field
  - still need to think about how to be contract-specific BS I suppose
    - much easier to just post-process in Excel or Python at that point, but could try proof of concept
x what is the cost if no volume increase? i.e. who pays what?
x case studies XR, XTX, Jump, Headlands, Eagle7, Spire X, Rigel Cove, Virtu, Wolverine
  x check Boerboel - still in E-minis, but left VIX
x check numerically how many firms (TPHs and customers) dwindled to nothing (let's try 90% decrease?)
  and whether that is attributable to late 2018 rebates changing
  x what even is a number of MMs benefitting from Tier Program? because customers don't
    *- about 66 TPH EFIDs; compare 40 accounts with Day Trading; that's an interesting thing to compare...
*. Write-Up Organization: 1) costs if nothing changed, and the drawbacks; 2) case studies of big MMs - not much effect?; 3) numerically chance of volume up
  - think about "potential boost" issues: 1) business line organization for MMs - EFID or account? 2) only so much churn edge to go around 3) VIX ETP ecosystem different to 2018
  - ask churn firms because we want them to benefit - do they need CTI 4? do they need lower threshold? 20k a month is quite high for that strategy
. AH SHIT. WE'RE LIMITING EFIDS TO THOSE IN THE SPREADSHEET FOR 2018 DAY TRADING
  - this is why numbers don't make sense for 2022-06
  - so here's the plan:
    1) download full VIX data, 2018-03 to 2022-06
    2) run code on it to generate full CTI 123 EFID ADV
      - sanity check it against the mm_volume_reshaped.csv
    3) put it through Tier Rebate and check the $3MM payouts check out at least for 2022 months official spreadsheet
    4) compare these payouts to Day Trading
      - yeah, will have to re-run Day Trading on full modern-day constituents
    5) aggregate top Tier Rebate and Day Trading candidates into sheets of spreadsheet, lay out the gist of the "cost"

. new roadmap: get further data from Eileen so we can get more exact list of 1) big MM firms, 2) small MM firms
  . refine methodology for "potential volume boost"
- Tier Program hidden factors: 1) all of Jump's EFIDs pay out the same (grouping rules)? 2) added/auction contracts, 3) removed contracts

- CME FedWatch Tool is the FOMC probabilities resource - shows target rate probability
  - actually assumes hike is 0.25 and Fed Funds rate doesn't go below 0
  - uses Fed Fund futures
  - uses a mechanism where if it's 104% chance of 0.25 hike, change to 4% 0.50 hike, 96% 0.25 hike

o Art Weekly 2022-07-01
  - Quantigo is index calculation provider for the European indexes (Stoxx, Dax, etc.); premier EU exchanges have non-exclusive contracts with
    Quantigo, Sean Smith moved from FTSE-Russell to Quantigo and reached out; we are pursuing for futures and options
    - positive margin treatment if both products are cleared at OCC
    - evaluations on size of market and profitability and conversion rate on market, etc.
    - EuroStoxx and Dax products would come first
      - cash settled 100 multiplier European settlement option is likely
    - CME is competing with us, but mostly on the futures part
      - Deters and Hocking negotiating, want exclusivity so CME doesn't get the future, but they may
  - AFX going into wind-down mode on 2022-07-15 unless they get letter of intent
    - go to skeleton staff to run markets for a couple months, maybe to 2022-09-30, then shut down
    - we will contact people to close out open interest (reg has OI info and can share to select business people) before the actual maturities
      - will wait until AFX announces early Sep to avoid info clash
    - OneChicago exercised emergency power to move up maturity dates, we could appeal to CFTC to do that
    - question: will AFX continue paying the one LMM to keep markets lit so we can close out?
    - the real estate contract that we terminated a few years ago had 1 customer holdout, and we had to pay the LMM contract by contract to
      give the customer a good price lol
    *- we could still buy Ameribor futures and host and market on our own
      - issue is the whole point of AFX was to give inroads to rates market, Cboe doesn't have even the resources for credit, let alone rates

  - uh oh, realized the tiered program is kind of exponential as hypothetical ADV increases
. re-evaluate all the numbers, emphasis on modifying existing Tiered Program rather than refresh everything with Day Trading
  - explain why I would much rather modify existing Tiered Program than overhaul:
----
I would much rather make targeted adjustments to the existing Tiered Program than overhaul it with the Day Trading program because Tiered can be adjusted to pay out exactly like 
Day Trading, but not the other way around. Estimating costs for adjusting Tiered Program is already a math problem with missing variables, and trying to estimate the separate overhaul 
to return to Day Trading would be a proxy on top of that.
The changes I would propose for Tiered would be:
1) Simplify the two tier systems into one, specifically removing the "% of monthly volume" tier
  - this brings Tiered closer to the spirit of Day Trading - less to worry about, clear threshold
2) Minor adjustments to which volume segment (low, middle, high; I will define) should have increased incentives and which to decrease
  - many low volume players, few high volume players - take from rich to give to poor?
    - increased edge for high volume when low volume is incentivized to do more? reverse trickle-down effect?
      - even if we get it wrong, we have benefit of cutting costs in the form of paying less rebate (to the top players, who presumably will not leave entirely)
3) Include CTI 4 customers
  - investigate exact details - what limitations does current Tiered program have on qualifying EFIDs for the rebates?
  . ping Bob Siverson to chat for 10 minutes on this?
    1) go through Jump example in the spreadsheet (why do all the EFIDs rebate the same? how do they combine?);
    2) EFIDs vs. accounts thoughts?;
    3) how does CTI 4 play into this? would we need to restructure Tiered Program to include CTI 4 or would it be like hitting a switch?
----

- Michael DiBenedetto is replacing Bob
  - his meeting email says:
o Options on Futures billing structure pattern same as for Futures
  - per product basis:
    - fee code for CTI 4 orders
    - fee code for non CTI 4
    - tiered rebate program
    - LMM program (oh shoot, I haven't thought about that in conjunction with rebate...)
  - fee codes for OoF distinct from those of underlying Futures
  - billing for EFIDs continues through Clearing Firm account at OCC
  - no need for separate invoices/advices from underlying Futures though...
  - OoF LMM program fully distinct from Futures, but existing daily reports will add in OoF info

o Bob call
----
- LMM program - changed from firm to EFID, but now can declare multiple EFIDs but they count as separate achieving entities (no one has done that yet)
- multiple desks can go through same EFID or separate; account is "unrelated" - firm can run all through same EFID or a bunch
  - Albert Jimenez at trade desk might have insight, or Tim Thedinger; both were around in 2018
    - both respond to Teams message much better than email
- CTI - capacity is more relevant
----
o Tim Thedinger call
  - one of the reasons he recalls for moving away from Day Trading was general shift away from using accounts
    - EFID organization more "harmonious" with options business
  - but Thomas Mueller would be guy for low-level details
o Thomas Mueller
----
- in options, called 75% ownership
- there is capability of being EFID-specific, used in equities, not in options and futures
- Rich Fuller would have more insight on hierarchy
- EFID is hierarchy, not parallel
- EFID is a BATS system standard in 2018; accounts not really used from billing anymore
- frequent trader ID is a field... investigate?
- invoice would indicate frequent trader on Futures; C1 would send money straight to freq trader
  - invoice_rows table? order_fill for sure has it
----
. Jenn good layout of details on Day Trading; call her
. Albert Jimenez call

- check how many accounts/sizes lost, to see which exact tiers to boost and cut
  - may need to make manual list of "lost" guys
    - must do this at the firm level, as accounts and even EFIDs shift
    - must also exclude CTI 4, then separately try a CTI 4 analysis (though it may just be obviously no effect because they weren't making Day Trading)
- 1st iteration - payout estimate with everyone holding same volume in the "new" tier system
- 2nd iteration with estimated losses from top end and boosts from mid and low end (need elasticity methodologies for this)

- LMAO just found a fee schedule saying fee schedule updated to Tiered program in 2018-08-01
  - https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/fee_schedule/2018/CFE-Fee-Schedule-Updates-Effective-August-1-2018.pdf
- 2018-12-01: Frequent Trader Program introduced! customers could enroll as of 2018-10-29
  - so Tiered program for TPHs, Frequent Trader program for customers; why the hell (and when) was it revoked?
    - https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/fee_schedule/2018/CFE-Fee-Schedule-Updates-Effective-December-1-2018.pdf
    - was still in effect as of 2019-06, I know that...
    - Art sent Matt McFarland letter from 2020-05-11 effective 2020-06-01 when Frequent Trarder was deleted
  - btw, between 2018-08 and 2018-12, CTI 4 was still getting Day Trading
With help from Art, this is the timeline, for the record:
1)	2007-09-04: original Day Trade pilot begins
2)	2018-08-01: Tiered program replaces Day Trade for TPHs (CTIs 1, 2, 3); Day Trade still in place for Customers (CTI 4)
3)	2018-12-01: Frequent Trader replaces Day Trade for Customers
4)	2020-06-01: Frequent Trader removed
This is helpful in establishing 2018-08 as the transition month from Day Trade to Tiered.

- Headlands does not do TAS

- Arianne call planning
----
- first big revelation - Danny previously told me 2018-11, which is what Art told him; yesterday I figured out Art had it wrong, for our purposes of MMs,
  2018-08 is the change date. I previously made a bunch of observations with "end of 2018" as my switch-over, now all of that is inaccurate - those
  observations were probably reflective of the actual SPX 10% drawdown that happened around 2018-12; 2018-08 is quite far from that
  - so basically, unfortunately, throw out the 4 firms I cited in the original email: Boerboel, Virtu, Headlands, Marquette
    - in fact, to double down, all 4 of these firms profited from the change to Tiered because they were above that 7000 ADV level;
      Virtu and Headlands specifically profiting way upwards of $30k and $80k a month respectively
- on Tiered being cheaper: no that was never the case. here are the numbers
  - I'm speaking with Thomas Mueller to debug some parts where my estimates are off, as well as get insight into TPH vs. Customer
- on number of firms dwindling/growing: really not significant
  - here's why: 18 dropped out, 16 joined; you can see visually they span the gamut. rebate change had no effect
- takeaway: I know I flip the script every couple days on this. my current take is I have tried to come at this from 
  many angles and there is no clear opportunity coming from this data other than cutting some of the payment the top tiers are getting.
  what we've tried to do here is look at one instance of changing the rebate in the past and then try to extrapolate how to
  make money by adjusting rebates again. my recommendation right now is "we should cut how much we pay top 5 and give it to
  mid and low tier MMs purely because the last change in rebate from Day Trading to Tiered did not really affect who traded and so
  we can do this without consequences, cut costs, and come out with a positive message that we're being nice to the low end"
----
. CTI 4

- Hue cache clearing solved Bhaven's problem

- Day Trading - way to find out end users
  - back then you were either a member or not - 3 fee schedules, CFE member, non-member, customer
- at time of BATS acquisition, CFE could stand on its own, wasn't relying on options delta hedging
- onus is on TPH to rebate it back to end user
  - force them to register for the coupon basically
- Dominice, Blue Diamond, CTC Investments (hedge fund we weren't aware of!)
  - big help for business development
- Day Trading also nice for firms to calculate costs ahead of time - Jenn also heard firms didn't like race for % in Tiers
- no EFIDs back then, but there was acronyms (3 letters?), Eagle7 was ESV or something
  - EFIDs let them choose who to clear
- big issue that Day Trading was by individual account, so it stopped aggregation
  *- now we have maybe opposite problem - no incentive to register; we need the onus back on the TPHs to identify their customers for us!
- Rich Fuller again as resource
- Jenn mentions FCM report is her resource for looking at CTI 4; I think I have more advanced data but want to see what she sees so I can give her resources
- Jenn: Frequent Trader failed because only 5 firms registered
  *- Holy Christ, no wonder Frequent Trader failed - minimum tier is 1000 ADV lmao only like 5 CTI 4 entities could ever come close to that
- Jenn recommends extending lower tiers all the way down - people want to feel the rebate

- ooh the CFE Termination Notice JIRA tickets would actually be good resources for how EFIDs and firm IDs change over time
  - 2022-07-29: effective as of business close, AMS Derivatives B.V. (firm AMSD), merging business into Optiver US LLC (OPTI)
    - all EFIDs transferred

- wow apparently Excel can't do Scatter and Line on same x-axis. what in the actual hell
  - oh my god it completely destroys the formatting capability of the chart if you try it. holy hell. you have to delete the chart and start over

. final sanity check will be to replicate spreadsheet numbers with Thomas Mueller
  - do NOT mess up daily vs monthly LMAO
. work out CTI 4 Frequent Trader program tiers
  - discuss with Arianne the concept of why it failed in 2018 and why it won't this time
. here's an out-there idea - what if we completely changed the shape of the tier line from concave to convex??
  - big incentive to climb the ranks in the middle!

. check effective spread against change in cost per contract
  - 2 angles (at least): ADV vs. cost per contract affecting spread???
. toxic flow, using effective spread to measure edge?? ask Michael Shea

. Nick Godec part 2: bid-ask spreads
  - 2021 avg bid-ask spread for iBoxx futures, most liquid segment of the market, tightest spreads, 1 month contracts
  - explicitly: ask minus bid (nominal) AND nominal divided by bid (%)
  . use Python to add days to maturity field (maybe see how we did it in correlations code?) to filter
. send info to Tim Thedinger once I reconcile

. method for manual adjustments to "member" vs. EFID etc.: need to have parallel columns with EFID
  - we can then cross-reference the billing statements to see "Agg ID" - e.g. which EFIDs of CTC are grouped together for the incentive!
*- Excel - how did I unpivot my year-months again???

. how much variation in month to month rebate payout?
  - ETPs

. toxicity - varies by CTI 1 vs. CTI 1, vs. the others

. Bhaven plans 2022-08-05
  - almost done with regimes interface
    - needs to add rolling window
  . add returns decomposition as a "drilldown" feature
  . make Bhaven write up some case studies - 2021-01 Gamestonk? 2020-03? etc.
    - ask for Parth and Pallavi Yoshiki case studies for reference
    - ours should mainly focus on VIX and highlight regimes, but in the course of writing those case studies,
      we might get ideas on other little widgets to add
  . before end of the week, ask to put time on Arianne's calendar to present Bhaven's web interface and write-ups
    . potentially show Kristen, Eileen, Angie
    . talk to Andrew Paulman about integrating this with Analytics Layer so it can run on a server indefinitely and not "download" any data

x send Danny spreadsheet and call him
. refine "perfect" data source so we get more reliable numbers
  - use allcat tables
  - dig up actual rebate reports for modern times
    . add all combo Agg IDs!
  - dig up actual rebate reports for Day Trading
    . uh I suppose this is just the Thomas Mueller mega sheet but can check elsewhere

. Futures update for Thursday!

o Clear/Prime Rebate Call
  - background: it looks like Clear (no Prime in VIX?) does 1000 a month (50 ADV) here or there, not anywhere near qualifying for rebates...
  - my questions: 1) how does cost per contract affect what you do in VIX futures? 2) is there anything from a rebate program perspective that would
    inspire Clear (or a firm of similar style)
  *- OMG Day Trading finally makes sense: Tiered system benefits high tiers because when their cost per contract is lower, theoretical profitable VIX price
     is satsified way "earlier" than for low tiers
    - I thought it had to do with the 5 cent spread, but it doesn't - it's just an earlier vs. later thing
    - issue though: no way to prove this quantitatively other than volumes, but there's an initial period where people try to compete
      . need to figure out that period - period then volume drop or exit!
  . we certainly need to get data further back in time - 2012 or 2015 at least - to determine whether we've truly lost variety, because this logic
    is sound and 2018 was crazy and firms may have already dropped out by Feb

x ping Dave Creagan about Cubs tickets

x get Bhaven access to create Stash repo
x ask EUC for Git for Windows and Git Bash for Bhaven

o Virtu Call with Andrew
  - they are optimizing their tech for speed right now (sounds like they tried a bunch of tweaks and still couldn't keep up... hope they figure it out)
    - they see TAS as the test for speed - if they can win the straight drag race, they're all set up
  - "react to a profitable trade earlier" effect definitely a big part of it
    . Andrew suggests making the tiers MUCH flatter (like Michael Shea I think), but there should still be an incentive in place
    . also suggests we should just go and tweak it, just see what happens!
  - even in day trade, there's still race for effective fee to put into their trading system, so there's no case of "Jump is so dominant that
    these other small/medium guys' strategies are obsolete"
---- Here's a script for future calls
- Hi my name is Gaibo, I'm in the Futures department, currently evaluating the current Tiered rebate program for possible tweaks
- These tweaks could come in the form of
  1) changing the current Tiers - one of the ideas is to strike out the current 2-tier style by eliminating the tier that depends on % of total volume
    - it feels like we get a lot of anecdotal complaints about how annoying it is that MMs can't know ahead of time their cost per contract
      because it will depend on how much volume others do
    - but at the same time, we acknowledge this % of total tier was put in place to account for big volume months vs. small volume months
      - though I'd also acknowledge in Futures, big and small volume isn't that big of a difference
  2) rejecting current Tier program, return to Day Trading program of 2018 and prior
    - *offer to explain the Day Trading program
    - reason for this is we're aware that with Tiers, there's a fundamental problem - the biggest MMs (say a firm that trades 50k ADV and gets 50 cents
      rebate) are getting way cheaper cost per contract than a medium sized MM (say a firm that trades 5k ADV and gets 30 cents rebate), which means
      the big firm's trading system even with the same theoretical VIX price "reacts to a profitable trade earlier"
      - now we want to gauge qualitatively how big of an annoyance this is - how much would we say this makes the big bigger?
    - now the issue with just going back to this flat-threshold system is that we lose Tiered program's spirit of carrot on a stick to the next tier
- now after saying all that, let's go back to the beginning: what are your thoughts - should we tweak current tiers, or throw it out for Day Trading?
*- so can I just ask, at your current ADV levels, what do you think about the current rebate program? are there any obvious objections or recommendations?
  - maybe I'd phrase a question like this: do you feel there is unfair competition for you in the market

. ask Michael - did Day Trading ever change? was it always threshold, the 20,001st contract on get the rebate?

o ARB with Adam the owner
  - several hundred traders across the globe
  - let traders use any platform: TT, CQG, Stellar, DMA, Silexx; not currently using CTS (Cunningham Trading Systems)
    - feel like costs are hurting them? what are we supposed to do? is anyone else doing this?
    - they do own a trading system (is it Rival? from Ronin) but won't force their traders to use it lmao
  - just launched their WEIX ETF
    - obviously this is not going to be MM volume affected by rebates; gonna be TAS volume
  - named Jump as "tech company" enemy lol
  *- clearly ARB is not helpful here for us - they are more strategies than MMs

o Dennis and Sarj - custom MSCI futures/options
  - like custom swaps business at banks?? custom index, different for each customer

o IMC with Ted and Jared
  - "F1" delta one desk
  - obviously p big on vol and futures - 4k ADV, historically even higher
  - worked with VolatilityShares
  - in tune with Barclays
  *- ETP operation: fees not a huge influencer, driven by ETF flow and futures prices themselves
    - fees 5 cents, they would benefit, but wouldn't change their volume
  - stocks world - trading basket of stocks, but at same time, exchanges come and ask them to look outside of box where incentives are more interesting
  - 2nd most active in UVIX and SVIX - futures trading up, familiar with risk profile
  - fees inspire new strategies, but particular ways of trading, but again, doesn't really affect IMC's ETF vs. VIX futures operation

. iBoxx data points before Monday EOD, TAC on Wednesday
  x add YTD total volume, YTD ADV, prev YTD total volume, prev YTD ADV, maybe 3x?
    x add QoQ and YoY? what does that even mean? OHH we should do QTD vs. prev Q
    - my existing stats are month-oriented, and this should be a second, separate page with higher level comparison
  . add VIX customer breakdown to June and July
  x add VXX update
    . do multiple regression
      . better quote on "normal" VXX volume, because that 60k number is unfair - it came during high vol!
  x add nicely updated TAC
iBoxx Notes:
- IBHY-HYG correlations are starting to look very good again, after decoupling after Fed stopped quantitative easing at end of 2020
  - during QE lasting through 2020, HYG/LQD borrow rates were kept artificially low - likely that iBoxx hedging was more difficult in 2021 and brought corr down
- IBHY still around all time highs of new accounts and active accounts
- IBHY: customer ADV just above median each month since May; takeaway should be that things are in flux - PGIM up, Florin Court down,
  Union down, Hilltop/AM West omnibus up, MS account way up, random Goldman account in big, ADM UK
  - July is up on previous month and quarter
- IBIG: really positive story - 3 consecutive customer volume records since May - Union, BMO Canada, Poetic Group, and some others have
  come in big time; Litch says Union are pushing more asset managers to come into product
TAC Meeting Prep for 2022-08-17:
----
  - hi guys I'm Gaibo from the CFE, so just gonna quickly go through CFE volumes
* BBG chart
  - context for VIX for the past 2 months: S&P straight up since that mid-June 75bp hike from the Fed (3700 to 4300, up 15% in 2 months), VIX straight down from 34 to 20
    - period of mid-April to mid-May had Fed signals everywhere and VIX volumes through the roof (265k), but since June (minus the 3 days in mid-June with inflation panic) very calm
* volume heatmap and Monthly
  - in context of this, we can look at June and July ADV for VIX of 190k and 180k, very low, no spikes
  - this is quite a new regime from everything that's happened this year
    - think back to Jan/Feb with real vol from Russia, Fed, inflation; March with loss of VXX (low volumes despite vol - this was the start of a whole different factor entirely);
      then in mid-April to mid-May we had shocking Fed announcements and mixed signals in SPX
* pull up VXX analysis
  - since I brought up VXX, I can touch on that - things haven't changed all that much on the VIX ETP front - UVXY is now THE conduit of vega in ETPs
  - we're still sorely missing that volume from VXX, but I will emphasize that we miss it "less" (as in smaller ADV drop) when we're in a lower vol regime like now
  - VolatiltyShares's UVIX and SVIX are growing nicely - UVIX in particular has continued growing fast in AUM and volume, SVIX not so much, but both combine for a drop in the bucket
    next to the loss in vega volume from VXX, though that is now a drop of water comparable to SVXY and VIXY
* finally pull up PDF
  - finally, we can glance through this PDF and I'll keep it up here as a visual, is there anything that jumps out
  - YTD, VIX actually doesn't look so bad, but obviously subject to change because it's 180k months until there's a 250k month, so you never know whether it's going to end above or below
    that 2021 215k number
  - mini-VIX has been struggling in recent months - rank 12; from digging a bit deeper, we're seeing declining # new customers each month and # active accounts since beginning of year
    - here's the surprising thing: there was no real increase in customers or customer driven volume in Fed vol of mid-April to mid-May
      - if it was just vol-based loss of volume, we would have seen a recovery there, but we didn't, which makes me think retail literally lost interest
        in playing around in VXM when the going got tough with inflation
• IBHY
  - Customer volume just above 12-month median each month since May (July: 1317, 5.9% share)
    *- Despite stable overall volume, customer activity in flux behind the scenes – stalwarts Union and Florin Court down in volume, but handful of other accounts (including several new or minor) are up
  *- New/active customers still at highest levels: 9 new, 53 active in July
  *- OI up 40% from Q2, finally recovering to 2021 average level (July: 1006)
• IBIG
  *- Customer volume hit 3 consecutive record months since May (July: 897, 7.2% share)
    - Really positive story – Union, BMO Canada, Poetic Group, and others have developed IBIG volumes significantly in past few months, and Union are pushing asset managers to start using the futures
  - New/active customers still at highest levels: 3 new, 17 active in July
  *- OI at highest ever, up 50% from Q2 (July: 656)
*• General iBoxx
  - Risk-based haircut: no-action letter presented, awaiting SEC formal response
  - Goldenberg set to become new member and market maker – trader reports timeline is “far better than expected”
  - IBHY-HYG correlations have moved back to perfect alignment after 1.5 years of decoupling since Fed ended QE of buying ETFs
    - QE lasted through 2020 and kept HYG (and LQD) borrow rates artificially low; likely that futures hedging/pricing was more difficult in 2021, as reflected in correlation
    - Restored correlation gives customers confidence to use product as designed – in tandem with HYG
- so that's it for me on futures volumes + some context on iBoxx development, I'll turn it back over, and I'll be here to answer any questions directed towards volumes as well, thank you!

o Market Timing with Implied Vol Indices - Yoshiki, Antonio, Kshitij, Yash, 2017-08
  . 10 and 90 guide lines
  . implied vs. realized vol regimes
    - when do they begin? lag in realized?
    - CCF chart?
  . tables to evaluate asset rotations? - Sharpe ratio, annualized return, max drawdown, max recovery in days
    - additional drawdown identification, profiling
  . returns decomp
o Closer Read
  *- define object of prediction as drawdown events, which coincide with periods of high realized vol
  - hypothesis: option-implied vol indexes have predictive power to future realized vol (and drawdowns)
  . empirical: scatterplot of monthly returns vs. realized vol for various assets
    - show whether asset is "traditional" in sense of worse returns when volatile
  . temporal clustering of negative returns
  - "clean" implied vol number is fair strike of a realized volatility swap, so model-independent
    - assumption is that options traders are skilled at forecasting vol with options pricing
  . 2 observations: 1) default low state, spurts of high; 2) upward spike steeper than descent (implying heightened vol period)
    - can we do something here? % low state vs. high; time to recover fully; etc.
    - steep ascent means our spike identification window is small if we want prediction to be useful
  . set parameters independently for realized and implied to fit specific vol index!

x call Charlie, ask about ETF/assets data
  x mention VIX ETP dashboard from months ago
  - BZX_ref_data because that's the primary listing exchange
    - etp_resources
    - listing_outstanding_shares - not available for non-BZX listed ETFs! but all VIX ETPs should be good...
  - equities_us
    - symbol_daily - daily info by symbol (OHLC), primary listing, one record per day
  *- chron jobs for updating Analytics Layer tables, then Python can query the "offline" table
. chase Charlie on VIX ETPs dashboard - he says in a week
  x ask Parth and Andrew about OI data source??
    . Parth says "next week", i.e. week of 2022-08-22
x call Bhaven on Monday, make sure you've read and tried to think of new ideas

- result of thinking about whether interpolation is okay for percentiles: no, we shouldn't. we should stick to values VIX actually took on
  . honestly, we should add histogram binning of VIX index days in the lookback window

- 2022-08-17: Danny trying to schedule VIX rebate call with Nirvana Technology Solutions with Anbaj
  - not existing VIX customer, but their customers are - use their software for speed

x ping Bhaven about Michael Shea
. remember to call Bhaven on Friday for final debrief - ask about full time

- Ed meeting on 8/23 delayed:
  - we're not there yet, still need to:
    - run by Hiatt, run through couple scenarios, run by market makers, make better cost estimate (growth standpoint)

o TAC Meeting 2022-08-17
  - Arianne opens it up for comments on VIX fees (options and futures) and pain points
    - options combo pain points?
    - functionality challenges? ECRP?
    - margin rules?
  - eliminate market maker fees for customer combos? + 1 other fee break
    - bring OTC trades to the floor
    - 2022-09-01 fee change (confidential until then)
  - tick regime change to pennies (options are only vol options still trading in nickels) in October
    - note complex orders already trade in pennies - 67% is already printing in pennies
    - SEC requires nothing can print outside of bid-ask spreads, so we've done big analysis to check floor trades prints
    - adding minimum quote size (don't want penny wide 1 up lol)
    - want new order type futures vs. options; cross between Cboe and CFE; mechanically easy, regulators (SEC vs. CFTC) may be insurmountable
  - VIX rebates: some customers feel beat out by unfair tiers/cost per contract, some that trade ETPs aren't affected at all
    - Zeke: really wants to go back! provided some incentive to encourage fellow guys to trade to get to the threshold (makes no sense)
      - current tiered program is unfortunate, even Zeke's group internalizes VIX flow (what does that mean?), benefits top 3-5 guys a ton
      - matching engine! Zeke says new system has made volume way more consolidated, and they've benefitted!
    - Mike Dennis: Day Trade brings different participants

x re-read Michael Shea's advice on leveling whole program
  - flatten rebate structure, reduce top level, boost "within reach" of 1k-7k
  - if MMs say rebates de minimis (unclear!), reduce all rebates by 30%-60% (but maybe cut top TPH fee to offset); this would be to level difference between top and bottom
  - consider tying VXM LMM to top rebates (LOL); this would clearly be for benefit of VXM

- 2022-08-19 close of trading: delisting Ameribor AMW futures!
  - AMB1, AMT1, and AMT3 still active for now

. VIX rebate program next steps:
  . accurate fees redo (Jesus that was so long ago - how was I doing it again?)
  . get data further back in time
    . contacting Annapurna for catch-up
  . flatten rebate structure once we get the accurate fees - draft 1, 2, 3 based on big spreadsheet
    - consider scenarios of 1) reducing all rebates, 2) exponential growth in 1k-7k?
  . think about day of month
  . think about RPC regression or recreation

. VIX top customers for 2022-07, then
  . write up sections for 2022-07
    . separately, write up TAC presentation to a confluence page of its own
  . write up sections for 2022-06
  . write up the VXX 2022-07 update lmao

. Charlie VIX ETP page
x Bhaven project
  x schedule meeting with 11am Eastern Friday Arianne

o iBoxx LMM Reports are wrong 2022-08-25
  - CFE LMM Performance Data reports (https://bats.bats.com/library/nfc/Reports/CFE_Lmm_Performance_Data/) are the single source of billing data
    - Irene interested in building out dashboard so we have 2 sources to sanity check
    - Ben Newberg is the person running these reports (and doing the impact analysis)

- Prep for Bhaven final debrief
  - how was your week?
  - do you want to give a brief overview of what we tried to do this summer, how we approached it, and then give a walkthrough of the product?
  - so what was next? what were some other ideas you what you would do immediately next? I mean I've got a list here as well but
  - how is commenting code and documentation coming along?
    - I really want a document where if someone else comes along, they can read it and know your exact mindstate so they can pick up your code seamlessly
  - do you want to come back?

- length of high and low vol regimes - return from spike
  - could be useful for intuition on % of total vs. absolute ADV cost analysis

o Bhaven Final Debrief, 2022-08-26
  - feedback: definitely need more frequent check-ins. intern is kind of just floating around, doesn't know what to ask about

- 2022-08-29 Derivatives iBoxx PPT
  - figured out there is still big issue with using my new_accounts_v3 spreadsheet - IBIG 2021-05, trading only happened like half the days of month,
    so pivot table is doing ADV wrong. damn it.
    - this was screwing things up big time when I tried to back out total volume using % of total

x to do: add Juneteenth to calendar functions in cboe_exchange_holidays_v3 (started 2021, financially observed 2022)
  x add days in month function to options_futures_expirations_v3
    - note to self: way to group months: account_cti_monthly = account_day.groupby(['Account', 'CTI', lambda x: x[2].year, lambda x: x[2].month]).sum()
      - better version is .groupby(pd.Grouper(freq='MS'))

. Jeff Moore - Advantage Futures question about overnight VIX volume and liquidity
  - what are they looking for? we have GTH volume for sure (internally we have US, Asian, European, etc., though curb has changed a few times),
    and also basic front month liquidity at the very least
  - first off, are we allowed to provide this information?

- rpt_tier_internal reports may be rounding ADVs down for qualification
  - columns J and K used for Tiering are both from everything CTI 1,2,3; the other numbers in sheet like Total Contracts are weird and I don't know how to replicate them
  - columns N and O with rebate * contracts has "correct" number of contracts, but column D with Total Contracts is just off, not sure why
    - originally thought it could be CTI 4, but no because Jump doesn't have CTI 4 and it's still off
      *- OH LMAO IT'S SUMMING ALL THE PRODUCTS TOGETHER. JUMP IS OFF BECAUSE OF MINI VIX VOLUME
- note to self - Excel->Manage Data Model->right click->Unpivot other columns to unstack grouped data; groupby can then be used
  - Leila Gharani, how to fill in NaNs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrfbv2h7p8&t=0s
- manually combine TPHs:
1) XTX - 2021-11 volume migration
2) Virtu - 2019-10 volume migration
3) CTC - all 3 together, though looks like 2022-01 CTC Investments volume migration to CTC Limited; CTC, LLC unaffected
4) 
- Flow Traders US, Flow Traders BV, and Flow Traders Asia do not pool together, interestingly - summed together they could be
- Rich Fuller, ask about entities being related

. RPC change - steady ratio, JUST look at fees
  - capture should go up, figure out volume for breakeven
  . ask again for RPC, simultaneously calculate from scratch

. send easy dashboard data to Danny and Jeff with Art's disclaimer text

- PNT Tech call was originally 2021-02
  - they were losing to XR hard, brought up UDP packet gamesmanship, we denied it
  - fast-forward to 2022-09, apparently a trader from XR went to PNT, and empirically we see their TAS volume way up?
    - correction: according to Jenn on 2021-02-08 email thread, Justin Harper was formerly at XR, had already been at PNT
      for a while already, was reason they came into TAS
    - empirically, PNT didn't do TAS volume until 2021-11, bits in chunks before then
      - but in 2021-11 they were immediately doing 90k, making them the biggest TAS firm after XR, Barclays, Eagle7
        - so they definitely figured it out shortly after 2021-02

- what's become clear to me is that there is a BIG issue flying under the radar for CFE, and that is data
  - I have literally been working on this on and off for a year, and I'm realizing even at this point, I am the
    only person in this entire company (other than Litch) that keeps up with futures data and the idiosyncracies and the nooks and crannies
    - and it weighs heavily on me, both in terms of 1) if I mess up, there is no double check, 2) I get pinged constantly
      by coverage team for very basic info that I've shown them the dashboards for a million times.
  - someone, preferably me, literally MUST be taken off all projects and set to work on data
    - I touched on this many, many months ago, but we need a suite of more refined Tableau data tools,
      need to workshop it with coverage team, need to develop several new ones, need to cut Bloomberg data dependency, etc.
      - right now, I am stuck running things manually because I have to choose - get the data out, or make the data easier, not both
  - the issue then obviously is that if I focus on tackling the data access problem,
    we need another person to do the day to day stuff so I don't get pulled away and have to context switch constantly
    - and that would be the explicit reason I would argue we need more people - there's a huge startup cost to starting to work on this
      futures stuff, so it can't just be borrowing Irene or Jonathan - that would actually just spend all of our time badly
- in summary: we should lay off tweaking VIX for "revenue gains" and go back to basics on data access and literacy
  - these data tools would then tie into "automated" analytics on VIX - a vein that always runs parallel to "improvements" on the VIX
    and can't be done simultaneously

- so hey do you have a good 10 minutes here? there's actually something I wanted to discuss further if that's alright.
  
so, I'm aware of my shortcomings for the past couple of months. They actually started with the pandemic - WFH has always given me major anxiety.
  I've been struggling with lack of focus but also with burnout for a long time now - burnout in the sense that I used to be able to focus long enough
  to get a deliverable out the door, but now after years of it, I can't help but know it's not going to make a difference.
  
I am tormented by tons of loose ends I've made over the years, and I haven't been able to find a solution to the burnout.
  so, I would like to resign, from my position at Cboe. to be clear, Arianne, you've been nothing but very generous with me, it's more I
  know for a fact I need to be away from my computer for a long time before I can go back to doing any meaningful work.
  
outside of burnout, I also feel that exchange work is probably not right for me. I really enjoyed product development and research,
  but I've never been a banker or trader, and at the end of the day, I feel like a melon salesman who's never eaten fruit - 
  I've gotten decent at knowing about melons, but there are people who should be doing this instead.

so I wanted to discuss with you what to do next - do you want 2 weeks notice, or a month, basically I want to help in transitioning me out, and at
  the very least to stop new projects from coming my way. I obviously want to finish the current VIX rebate project, but at this point I may be
  more trouble than it's worth.

- 2022 Fcst 4 + 2023
  - VIX RPC stay the same - VIX rebate program may change that

x ah damn it new format of Historical Daily Volume Breakdown breaks manual VIX Top Customers thing because there is a new column - Port Owner!
  - no idea how I should migrate data source, because that destroys all the pivot tables
  - I added legacy data source into Obsolete Tableau directory, screw it

- 2022-08-26: stocks tank after hawkish Powell Fed message - "restrictive policy for some time... historical record cautions against loosening"

. upload all Git files, put "scratch" into GZAP folder to get into cloud
  . do zipped code folders as well
  . do zipped system folders as well
. look into metadata storage in Git - I had no idea timestamps are wiped anytime I checkout a different branch damn

- filtering Tableau general volumes (not TPH-context):
  1) Futures Root, 2) Trade Date, 3) CTI, 4) Monthly/Weekly, 5) Product Type (TAS, etc.), 6) Complex (outright, spread, block, ECRP), 7) Session

- 8/31 Benchmark Plus unwound their whole position, ironically against Goldenberg who just came in to help; Litch thinks they'll be back
- 9/1 Goldenberg are happy so far; using ABN's pipes, speeds slow so defensive, waiting for Redline
- from 2022-10-17, Eurex is going to offer Euro-denominated HY corporate bond futures
  - wonder how they're going to deal with the settlement week problem?

x make list of everything I'm working on
x monthly things that get done
x side projects
x list everyone who's asking for each of these tasks
- some combo of Irene/Jonathan + Angie/Charlie should be able to get everything
x 2 weeks, not 4 for transition out: 9/23

x ask Arianne about afternoon meeting - version 2 of document is ready with more details; is that the kickoff or should I start throwing meetings on calendar?
. meet with:
  . Charlie
  . Annapurna
  . Litch
    . Nick Godec files too
  . Hemal
    . fair value too, personal contact
  . Sarj
  x Parth
    . follow up
  x Danny
  x Dennis
  x Tiago
    . follow up
  x John
  x Jonathan and Irene
  . Mike and Joe
  x Jenn
  x Rebecca if she's in office

. document VIXTLT in a Word doc - how did Matt Bukowski set it up again? it was super complicated
  . update my code to use the cashflows file
  . update my code to also calculate from scratch, complete with web scraping

. iBoxx folder + code for Litch to parse with help of DStrat

- VXX re-opening new issuances at market open 2022-09-26!!

- Irene and Shea need PrdDevSharedDB still

- futures insights, small data details are most important parts of presenting
  . in that case, one more 1-hour session of showcasing dashboards, then code, then Excel spreadsheets should do it

- Snowflake Training
  - it's a database system built on top of AWS
  - can reduce servers when not needed, don't need to pay as many engineers to manage software updates, cloud has higher redundancy and up time
  - warehouses are how Snowflake represents computer resources for queries (cost to Cboe)
  - Hadoop SQL and Snowflake SQL have minor differences
  - micro-partitions - Snowflake intelligently groups chunks of data together, we should check how many partitions the query looks through and minimize
    - do smallest joins first
    - functions on data in a "where" clause can cause analyzer to scan every piece of data. bad. (Snowflake may intelligently eliminate these, confusingly)
      - select * from random_table where DATEADD(DAY, 1, dt) > '2022-05-06'; // bad because have to scan every dt to add 1 then evaluate
      - select * from random_table where dt > DATEADD(DAY, 1, '2022-05-06'); // better as function is on a constant
    - faster to do lots of 1-day joins than 1 large join over a year!! Analytics Layer runMultiDayQuery() is based on this
    - no joins in where clause (in case of outer joins, there can be null rows that are missed)
      - where ... and ... BAD but on ... where .. GOOD

Hue Queries

dates	This is how you use dates in queries

select * from block_trade where block_trade.trade_ts >= '2020-01-01'

parent_clearing_firm	Relationship between EFID, firm MPID, firm name, firm's parent clearing

- ah so I finally figured out how to read emails/download attachments with Python - need to use imaplib and email libraries, and it is very convoluted

- URL "query parameters" consist of start (?), information (key=value), separator (&)

- so I finally figured out how to read attachments from emails + how to scrape websites with hidden JavaScript sections,
  needed for shares outstanding and dividends respectively for calculating cashflows from holdings files for BP VIXTLT
  - but we don't need that anymore - document BlackRock cashflows FTP instead

x add to Mini collection
x add instructions on setting up code environment
x Chris Morris "moving to API" when we asked him about BlackRock FTP
